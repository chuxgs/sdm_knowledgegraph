The approach is based on viewing the original system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) as a type of distributed parameter system (DPS), and subsequently defining realizable controllers by approximating the DPS with scattered bases over a domain of interest. The approach provides rigorous bounds on ultimate performance guarantees for uncertainty classes defined in the native space. One result derives an upper bound on the ultimate performance of the adaptive controller in terms of the power function. Another version of this upper bound shows how the ultimate performance can bounded in terms of a fill distance of centers of approximation in subsets that contain the closed loop trajectory. In contrast to the general theory for error bounding adaptive controllers in Euclidean space, the general approach in this paper works for functional uncertainties in any RKHS.",2023,0

In particular, we use robust-adaptive control barrier functions (raCBFs) to achieve safety. We develop new theories and techniques using sum-of-squares that enable us to pose synthesis and verification as a series of convex optimization problems. In our experiments, we show that our algorithms are general and scalable, applying them to three different polynomial systems of up to moderate size (7D).

During the air–water trans-media locomotion, there are medium mutations and solid–liquid gas coupling phenomena, resulting in the complex dynamic process of HAUV. To ensure stable control during the trans-media process of a variable sweepback vehicle, this study proposes a neural-network-based adaptive dynamic surface control method for aircraft flight-path angle. This method aims to establish an effective control model for the entire process of air to media transition, in response to the characteristics of uncertainty and external disturbances in the process of variable backsweeping in the air and media transition. By utilizing the multibody dynamics method, the dynamic equations for variable-swept vehicles are established and transformed into a rigorous feedback system with model uncertainty. The adaptive dynamic surface method in this paper introduces a first-order filter, which overcomes the “differential explosion” problem in traditional backstepping control design through differential filtering; the unknown parameters present in the model are estimated online through adaptive laws, and the uncertain parts of the system are overcome through nonlinear damping items. By analyzing Lyapunov stability, the semi-global stability of the required closed-loop system can be obtained, and adjusting the controller parameters can make the tracking error infinitely small. Numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the tracking control of flight-path angles for different plunge-diving angle rates and strategy of ingress. The results show that HAUV with variable-swept configuration with different strategy has a great effect on the stability of plunge-diving locomotion; the designed controller can effectively track the target trajectory and has a certain degree of robustness and adaptability.",2023,0

The key point is that the non-affine control law can be designed and the output of the KKV system conform to the output limit with the aid of the proposed method. Due to the aerodynamic moments, the actual control torque is non-affine, which can be addressed by introducing an integral process to the design of the controller.

This paper proposes a robust cascade MRAC for nonlinear plants representing a class of these systems, which includes n renewable energy converts and a DC/AC single-phase full bridge inverter. The proposal reduces commissioning time by avoiding linearization and knowledge of the plant parameters.

However, the available constant pressure drop control valve cannot realize servo tracking without static error and, often, a high proportional gain is used to reduce the static error and improve the servo tracking performance, which reduces the stability margin. In this paper, an integral constant pressure drop control valve is designed, which consists of an integral controller and a stabilizing controller. Moreover, a robust LQR design method is proposed to complete the design task. Firstly, the controlled plant’s state–space model is derived, and the augmented model with tracking error is established based on the robust servo system design theory. Secondly, a servo controller with dual functions of integral control and stabilization control is constructed and decoupled, in which the stabilizing controller guarantees the asymptotic stability as well as the anti-disturbance performance, and the integral controller realizes the servo tracking without static error. Finally, based on the robust LQR design method, two key design parameters, including the integral control gain and the stabilization control gain, are designed to complete the design task. The simulation results indicate that, even when suffering 50 mm2 metered flow area step disturbance and 1 MPa inlet pressure step change, the designed integral constant pressure drop control valve can realize the function of servo tracking without static error.

This model is then implemented as the plant model in an NMPC. For real-time implementation of the LSTM-NMPC, an open-source package acados with the quadratic programming solver HPIPM (High-Performance Interior-Point Method) is employed. This helps LSTM-NMPC run in real time with an average turnaround time of 62.3 milliseconds. For real-time controller prototyping, a dSPACE MicroAutoBox II rapid prototyping system is used. A Field-Programmable Gate Array is employed to calculate the in-cylinder pressure-based combustion metrics online in real time. The developed controller was tested for both step and smooth load reference changes, which showed accurate tracking performance while enforcing all input and output constraints. To assess the robustness of the controller to data outside the training region, the engine speed is varied from 1200 rpm to 1800 rpm.

The combined control structure solves the input saturation and stability problem for inertia varying quadcopters. The control synthesis follows the conventional two-step anti-windup design paradigm where a nominal controller is designed without consideration of the input saturation, and the anti-windup compensator is designed to minimize deviations from nominal performance caused by saturated inputs. To account for varying inertia of the quadcopter during package retrieval/delivery routines, the inertia parameters of the vehicle/package are estimated with an online recursive identification technique. These estimates are used by the model reference adaptive controller to ensure stability of the nominal (unsaturated) system and to schedule the parameter-dependent anti-windup compensator. The performance and stability conditions of the parameter-dependent anti-windup compensator are formulated as a set of parameter-dependent linear matrix inequalities. When solved, the linear matrix inequalities yield a gain-scheduled anti-windup compensator that ensures stability and minimizes the deviation from nominal model reference adaptive control performance when saturation occurs. The effectiveness of the combined control scheme is demonstrated by simulations of an input constrained quadcopter lifting a payload of unknown mass.",2022,3

Such an approach is based on the direct self‐tuning regulators design framework and the exponentially stable adaptive control technique developed earlier by the authors. Unlike the known solutions, a procedure is proposed to obtain a non‐overparametrized regression equation (RE) with respect to the unknown controller parameters from an initial RE of the LQ‐based reference tracking control system. On the basis of such result, an adaptive law is proposed, which under mild regressor finite excitation condition provides monotonous convergence of the LQ‐controller parameters to an adjustable set of their true values, which bound is defined only by the machine precision. Using the Lyapunov‐based analysis, it is proved that the mentioned law guarantees the exponential stability of the closed‐loop adaptive optimal control system. The simulation examples are provided to validate the theoretical contributions.",2022,3

Recently, a high-order tuner algorithm was developed for the minimization of convex loss functions with time-varying regressors in the context of an identification problem. Based on Nesterov’s algorithm, the high-order tuner was shown to guarantee bounded parameter estimation when regressors vary with time, and to lead to accelerated convergence of the tracking error when regressors are constant. In this paper, we apply the high-order tuner to the adaptive control of a particular class of discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems. First, we show that for plants of this class, the underlying dynamical error model can be causally converted to an algebraic error model. Second, we show that using this algebraic error model, the high-order tuner can be applied to provably stabilize the class of dynamical systems around a reference trajectory.",2022,0

Adaptive control laws can endow even nonlinear systems with good trajectory tracking performance, provided that any uncertain dynamics terms are linearly parameterizable with known nonlinear features. However, it is often difficult to specify such features a priori, such as for aerodynamic disturbances on rotorcraft or interaction forces between a manipulator arm and various objects. In this paper, we turn to data-driven modeling with neural networks to learn, offline from past data, an adaptive controller with an internal parametric model of these nonlinear features. Our key insight is that we can better prepare the controller for deployment with control-oriented meta-learning of features in closed-loop simulation, rather than regression-oriented meta-learning of features to fit input-output data. Specifically, we meta-learn the adaptive controller with closed-loop tracking simulation as the base-learner and the average tracking error as the meta-objective. With both fully actuated and underactuated nonlinear planar rotorcraft subject to wind, we demonstrate that our adaptive controller outperforms other controllers trained with regression-oriented meta-learning when deployed in closed-loop for trajectory tracking control.",2022,10

Firstly, to estimate and compensate the uncertainties existing in CAUS coordinate dynamics, an adaptive antidisturbance formation control law, which is combined by a robust adaptive control law and the second order disturbance observer, has been designed. Secondly, aiming at the adverse influences caused by the nonlinear time-varying nonlinearities existing in the formation flight dynamics, the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is introduced. Furthermore, considering the rapidly varying characteristics of the aforementioned formation flight nonlinearities, a novel board RBFNN (B-RBFNN) has been constructed and utilized to improve the approximation and compensation performance. In virtue of the fusing of the B-RBFNN and the second-order disturbance observer-based adaptive formation control law, the rapid response rate and the higher control accuracy of the formation control system can be achieved. As a result, a novel B-RBFNN-based intelligence adaptive antidisturbance formation control algorithm has been established for CAUS trajectory coordination and formation flight.

An actor‐critic RL agent is designed using the performance‐driven reward functions and tracking error observations from the environment. In the training phase, a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is utilized to learn the time‐varying adaptation strategy of the design parameter in the reference model feedback gain matrix. The proposed control structure provides the possibility to learn numerous adaptation strategies across a wide range of flight and vehicle conditions instead of being driven by high‐fidelity simulators or flight testing and real flight operations. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated on an identified and verified mathematical model of an agile quadrotor platform. Monte‐Carlo simulations and worst case analysis were also performed over a benchmark helicopter example model.

Therefore, a wide array of available continuous‐time results addressing transient performance issues using adaptive control algorithms cannot be applied or readily extended to the discrete‐time case. In this article, we present a new model reference adaptive control architecture for discrete‐time uncertain dynamical systems.

While it is of common practice to use reference models with linear dynamics, this can lead to limitations on the achievable closed-loop dynamical system performance – especially for applications involving highly capable dynamical systems such as highly manoeuvrable aircraft, missiles, and space launch vehicles. Because, linear reference models for these applications can only approximate the desired closed-loop behaviour of these nonlinear dynamical systems in narrow regions of the state-space.

In addition, to avoid suffering from the problem of ‘explosion of terms’, a dynamic surface control approach is employed by introducing the first‐order low‐pass filter. Furthermore, at every step of the backstepping design procedure, fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the unknown structure uncertainties. In particular, the norms of weight matrices and the upper bounds of approximation errors of fuzzy logic systems are supposed to be unknown. It is also shown that the proposed controller can guarantee the uniform boundedness of uncertain strict‐feedback nonlinear systems. Finally, the simulation for a single‐link manipulator actuated by a brush DC motor is carried out to illustrate the validity of the proposed controller.",2019,8

In the monitoring mission, many obstacles are in front of the UAV flight path so that it can interfere with the UAV flights. Therefore, the UAV requires a control system to avoid these obstacles without causing excessive overshoot. The obstacle avoidance system in this research uses the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) method. LQR plays a role in producing full state feedback gain K. The deflection angle of all control surfaces and Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals as brushless motor rotational speed regulators are set to produce a force and torque according to the result of the full-state feedback controller. Control phase of avoiding obstacles is divided into three, namely cruise, climb, and descent. This research shows that LQR-based controls play a role in stabilizing UAV motion when avoiding obstacles. The obstacle avoidance process follows a pattern generated by the flight pattern generator.",2019,4

The actuated dynamical system is considered to have a measurable state for feedback control, whereas only the output is available from the unactuated dynamical system. Specifically, the control objective for this class of dynamical systems is to allow a desired subset of the state of the actuated dynamical system to follow given commands in the presence of uncertain parameters and unactuated dynamical system coupling. To this end, our contribution is a mixed state and output feedback framework in the context of model reference adaptive control, which is predicated on integrated nominal and adaptive control laws. The key feature of the proposed model reference adaptive control architecture is to guarantee stability of the closed-loop coupled dynamical system as well as to assign user-defined bounds on system error trajectories utilised by the adaptive control law for achieving a prescribed level of overall system performance.",2019,5

The scalar field to be estimated is assumed to be represented by positive definite radial basis kernels and we use techniques from adaptive control and Lyapunov analysis to prove the stability of the proposed estimation algorithm. The convergence of the estimated parameter values to the true values is guaranteed by planning the motion of the mobile sensors to satisfy persistence‐like conditions. Two kinds of estimation algorithms are proposed: (1) where each mobile sensor estimates the entire parameter vector, (2) where each mobile sensor estimates only part of the parameter vector. Simulations are used for validating the algorithms.

It is well-known that the standard model-reference adaptive control (MRAC) cannot be used to control non-SPR plants to track an ideal SPR reference model. Due to the ideal property of asymptotic tracking, MRAC attempts an unstable pole-zero cancellation which results in unbounded signals for non-minimum phase SISO systems. The optimal control modiﬁcation can be used to prevent the unstable pole-zero cancellation which results in a stable adaptation of non-minimum phase SISO systems. However, the tracking performance using this approach could suffer if the unstable zero is located far away from the imaginary axis. The tracking performance can be recovered by using an observer-based output feedback adaptive control approach which uses a Luenberger observer design to estimate the state information of the plant. Instead of explicitly specifying an ideal SPR reference model, the reference model is established from the linear quadratic optimal control to account for the non-minimum phase behavior of the plant. With this non-minimum phase reference model, the observer-based output feedback adaptive control can maintain stability as well as tracking performance. However, in the presence of the mismatch between the SPR reference model and the non-minimum phase plant, the standard MRAC results in unbounded signals, whereas a stable adaptation can be achieved with the optimal control modiﬁcation. An application of output feedback adaptive control for a ﬂexible wing aircraft illustrates the approaches.",2018,4

In fact a major issue in adaptive system design is the inability to achieve, a-priori, non-conservative user-defined performance guarantees. At present most of the available analysis tools provide performance bounds depending on the norm of uncertain quantities. Since it is extremely difficult to quantify these quantities, conservative upper bounds are used in their place; these, in turn, produce conservative performance bounds of limited practical utility. To face these problems some of the authors have recently introduced a set-theoretic adaptive controller based on generalized restricted potential functions. The key feature of this approach is that it allows the norm of the tracking error to be less than a-priori userdefined worst-case performance bound, and hence, it has the capability to enforce strict performance guarantees. Since this performance is expressed as function of the norm of the error vector it is not possible to have the direct control on the amplitude of the single error components. In this paper the method is improved by allowing the control of the shape of the performance (ellipsoidal) set that is guaranteed to contain the tracking error trajectories. The design problem is formalized as a linear optimization with LMI constraints that allows specifying independent componentwise requirements for the error components.

On the one hand, the nonlinear model for the quadrotor UAV is decomposed in the rotational and translational systems. Thus, a second–order subsystem for each attitude angle is extracted from the rotational system dynamics. Then, under the assumption that a linear–in–the–parameters model for each subsystem can be defined, each subsystem is represented by a parameterized model from which a direct MRAC is designed. On the other hand, a second–order subsystem for each translational coordinate is extracted from the translational system dynamics. Then, a PID controller is implemented for each translational coordinate subsystem. The performance of our decentralized control scheme is validated via simulation results taking into account parametric variations, noise in the measurements and external perturbations.",2017,0

First, we design an adaptive control protocol which employs quaternion feedback for the object orientation to avoid potential representation singularities. Second, we propose a control protocol that guarantees predefined transient and steady-state performance for the object trajectory. Both methodologies are decentralized, since the agents calculate their own signals without communicating with each other, as well as robust to external disturbances and model uncertainties. Moreover, we consider that the grasping points are rigid and avoid the need for force/torque measurements. Load distribution is also included via a grasp matrix pseudoinverse to account for potential differences in the agents’ power capabilities. Finally, simulation and experimental results with two robotic arms verify the theoretical findings.",2017,41

The implementation feasibility of designed robust control systems based on the capabilities of the autopilot hardware is investigated. A robust proportional integral derivative and robust adaptive proportional integral derivative control are designed based on the considerations of the robustness of the system's behavior as well as hardware considerations. With a robust control system based on mu-synthesis, it is possible to achieve better reference signal tracking and disturbance rejection. But the hardware processor speed of the existing autopilot makes it impossible to implement this controller.

The control design process consists of first designing an inner-loop controller for a reduced order plant model to enforce command tracking of selected inner-loop variables, with an adaptive element used to accommodate parametric uncertainties in the plant. Once this inner-loop control design is complete, an outer-loop is then designed, which prescribes the inner-loop commands to enforce command tracking of selected outer-loop variables. The main challenge that needs to be addressed when designing the inner-loop controller is the determination of a corresponding square and strictly positive real transfer function. This is accomplished by appropriate selection of two gain matrices that allow the realization of such a transfer function, thereby allowing a globally stable adaptive output feedback law to be generated. The outer-loop controller is designed around the plant with existing adaptive inner-loop controller such that global stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed. The design of the outer-loop uses components of a closed-loop reference model in a judicious manner which enables a modular approach, without requiring any re-design of the inner-loop controller. In addition, this architecture facilitates the use of an additional state-limiter to enforce desired limits on the state variables. A numerical example based on a scramjet powered, generic hypersonic vehicle model is presented, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed control design.",2017,9

Tuning the controller is posed as an optimization problem to meet command tracking requirements subject to multiple design constraints.

In this work, a multi-objective H∞ robust controller is designed and applied to the power control of a Concentered Solar Power plant composed by two turbines, a gear and a generator. In order to provide robust performance and stability in presence of disturbances, not modeled plant dynamics and plant-parameter variations, the advanced features of the μ-analysis are exploited. A high order controller is obtained from the process of synthesis that makes the implementation of the controller difficult and computational more demanding for a Programmable Logic Controller. Therefore, the controller order is reduced through the Balanced Truncation method and then discretized. The obtained robust control is compared to the current Proportional Integral Derivative-based governing system in order to evaluate its performance, considering unperturbed as well as perturbed scenarios, taking into account variations of steam conditions, sensor measurement delays and power losses. The simulations results show that the proposed controller achieves better robustness and performance compared to the existing Proportional Integral Derivative controller.",2017,7

The emerging interest in distributed inter-vehicle communication networks has provided new tools for further improvements of the performance of this platoon-based driving pattern. A leading control strategy of such vehicular cyber-physical systems is Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC). However, a crucial limitation of the state-of-the-art is that string stability can be proven only when the vehicles in the platoon have identical driveline dynamics (homogeneous platoons). In this paper, we present a novel CACC strategy that overcomes the homogeneity assumption and that is able to adapt its action and achieve string stability even with uncertain heterogeneous platoons. Considering a one-vehicle look-ahead topology, we propose a Model Reference Adaptive Control augmentation: the control objective is to augment a baseline CACC, proven to be string stable in the homogeneous scenario, with an adaptive control term that compensates for each vehicle's unknown driveline dynamics. Asymptotic convergence of the heterogeneous platoon to a string stable platoon is shown analytically for an appropriately designed reference model. Simulations of the proposed CACC strategy are conducted to validate the theoretical analysis.",2017,17

It means that the system has some control inputs is lower than its DOF (Degrees of Freedom). This condition causes quadrotor to have limited mobility because of its inherent under actuation, namely, the availability of four independent control signals (four-speed rotating propellers) versus 6 degrees of freedom parameterizing quadrotor position or orientation in space. If a quadrotor is made to have 6 DOF, a full motion control system to optimize the flight will be different from before. So it becomes necessary to develop over actuated quad tiltrotor. Quad tiltrotor has control signals more than its DOF. Therefore, we can refer it to the overactuated system. We need a good control system to fly the quad tiltrotor. Good control systems can be designed using the model of the quad tiltrotor system. We can create quad tiltrotor model using its dynamics based on Newton-Euler approach. After we have a set of model, we can simulate the control system using some control method. There are several control methods that we can use in the quad tiltrotor flight system. However, we can improve the control by implementing a modern control system that uses the concept of state space. The simulations show that the quad tiltrotor has done successful translational motion without significant interference. Also, undesirable rotation movement in the quad tiltrotor flight when performing the translational motions resulting from the transition process associated with the tilt rotor change was successfully reduced below 1 degree.",2017,13

To overcome this limitation the authors propose a novel probabilistic framework where uncertain parameters and control signals are considered as random variables. In this framework the RS design is translated into a stochastic convex optimisation problem. This brings the benefit that (probabilistic) LMIs with reduced conservatism can be worked out.

The goal of this article is to achieve the desired tracking in the presence of uncertainty in order to guarantee the stability as well as improving the performance of the vehicle. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, the adaptive laws of stable predictor-based state feedback have been derived. In order to evaluate the advantages of proposed controller, first the performance of non-adaptive linear quadratic regulator controller in nominal conditions has been presented. By adding uncertainty to the vehicle dynamics, the performance of controller has been reduced. Then, by augmenting model reference adaptive control to linear quadratic regulator, the performance has been improved. Finally, a considerable improvement has been achieved in transient response and control signal using predictor-based model reference adaptive control. Simulation results show that by adding predictor-based model reference adaptive control to the system, uncertain part of the vehicle dynamics is approximated, and the tracking structure of integrated control (linear quadratic regulator + predictor-based model reference adaptive control) has been successful.",2015,10

It proposes a systematic two-step control design approach, which ultimately results in a two degrees-of-freedom structure. In this approach, the unstable plant is first stabilized by a parallel feedback stabilizer with minimum weighted energy. In the second step of the design, a mixed-sensitivity H∞ controller is designed on the basis of the stabilized plant to improve the overall performance of the closed-loop system. Through the proposed method, the bandwidth of the overall closed-loop system can be systematically expanded (increased) in the second step of the design.

This approach extends concurrent learning adaptive control to a wider class of systems with unmatched uncertainties that lie outside the space spanned by the control input, and therefore cannot be directly suppressed with inputs. The hybrid controller breaks the problem into two parts. First, a concurrent learning identification law guarantees the estimates of the unmatched parameterization converges to the actual values in a determinable rate. While this begins, a robust reference model and controller maintain stability of the tracking and matched parameterization error. Once the unmatched estimates have converged, the system exploits this information to switch to a more aggressive controller to guarantee global asymptotic convergence of all tracking, matched, and unmatched errors to zero. Simulations of simple aircraft dynamics demonstrate this stability and convergence.",2015,18

This paper focuses on the development of a viable adaptive control approach (ACA) for spacecraft motion trajectory (SMT). The proposed strategy involves the nonlinear mathematical model of SMT expressed in the central field, which is linearized by the Taylor expansion, and the second Lyapunov method to offer a high rate and unfailing performance in the functioning. The adaptive control system is composed of the cascade of adaptation loop and feedback control loop. When the spacecraft deviates from its reference trajectory model, the ACA acts on the control system to correct this deviation and follow the optimal reference trajectory. Therefore, when the states of the adjustable model are different from its reference values, then the error signal is provided as an input to the adaptation law, which contains the adaptation algorithm. The output will be the state variable feedback control matrix, which will be used to calculate the new control law vector. The efficiencies of the linearization procedure and the control approach are theoretically investigated through some realistic simulations and tests under MATLAB. The steady‐state errors of control between the reference model and the adjustable model of SMT converge to zero. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2015,2

To address this problem, we present a new approach to improve the transient performance of adaptive control architectures. In particular, our approach is predicated on a novel controller architecture, which involves added terms in the update law entitled artificial basis functions. These terms are constructed through a gradient optimisation procedure to minimise the system error between an uncertain dynamical system and a given reference model during the learning phase of an adaptive controller.

"e217010b880fc265148c45dfc60f9b32aae61ffd","A Design, Analysis and Verification Framework for Adaptive Flight Control","Safety-critical aerospace systems require stringent stabilization or tracking performance that have to be guaranteed in the face of large system uncertainties and abrupt changes on system dynamics. Considering Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) schemes, while aggressive adaptation rates can, theoretically, produce a fast convergence of the tracking error to zero, this is often achieved at the expense of high frequency chattering and peaking in the control signal that could be unacceptable for practical applications. Due to the inherent nonlinear nature of MRAC schemes it is not easy to rigorously predict the response of the uncertain adaptive systems especially during transients. This is testified by the lack of clear and easy verification procedures for existing adaptive control schemes that relate design parameters to time domain specifications. To face this problem, we propose a design and validation framework where stability and performance requirements for the adaptive system are all formulated in terms of Linear Matrix Inequalities. This brings the advantage that the adaptive controller design and verification can be analyzed and optimized through the solution of a convex optimization whose objective is to guarantee the evolution of the error components within an a-priori specified invariant set. This approach was applied to verify the performance of a recently introduced MRAC scheme featuring a feedback contribution in the reference model that is proportional to the current tracking error. This architecture is deemed particularly appropriate to face uncertainty in real applications. A detailed design example applied to a generic flexible structure aircraft transport model is presented to highlight the efficacy of the proposed verification architecture.",2015,3

The architecture is similar to Linear Quadratic Gaussian controllers. When using full order observers, or Kalman filters, the stability robustness properties can typically degrade, and the system can be sensitive to errors in the plant model. The method presented here, called observer-based loop transfer recovery, asymptotically achieves positive real system behavior at certain loop break points during recovery. This paper presents design insight into using this method for flight control design problems, including systems using acceleration feedbacks that are nonminimum phase. During the design process the observer is artificially squared-up. This adds fictitious inputs to make the number of controls equal the number of measurements, and makes the observer design model minimum phase. This step is central to achieving the positive real behavior during recovery. To place the zeros in a desired location during plant squaring, a pole-placement algorithm is used. A design example using the X-45A Joint Unmanned Combat Air System dynamics is utilized to highlight the design approach.",2013,9

The proposed controller is able to fly the VFA model under two types of model uncertainties, i.e. plant uncertainties and actuator anomalies, which commonly exist for a long endurance flight. The first step towards the solution is the development of a reduced-order model. Based on the model, a baseline linear LQG controller is applied for the flight under nominal conditions.

One promising approach for powering these motors in variable speed applications is using an M3C due to its inherent fault tolerance capability. However, M3C converters require a more complex control system than simpler converters. For instance, a basic M3C control system for power transmission requires seventeen PI controllers, whose fixed adjustment depends on the M3C’s dynamical model parameters’ value knowledge, needing initial extensive and time-consuming testing to obtain it. As an alternative, we propose an adaptive M3C control system for variable speed drives powering multiple PMSM-driven centrifugal pumps that reduces the number of controllers to six. Furthermore, the proposal does not require initial knowledge of the converter, motor, or load parameters, making it more practical and versatile. The proposal introduces an ad hoc hybrid passivity-based model reference adaptive controller in cascade with a passivity-based control. It was validated through theoretical stability proof and comparative simulation results with a basic control system under normal and fault operations. As a result, the proposal effectively follows the required rotor speed while enhancing performance by decreasing the current consumption and recovering from a 10% input phase imbalance, a cell short circuit, an open cell, and parameters changes of the motor–pump set.",2023,1

The main purpose of this study is to reduce the engine-out nitrogen oxide ( N O x ) emissions and to minimize fuel consumption while tracking a reference engine load. First, a physics-based engine simulation model is developed in GT-Power and calibrated using experimental data. Using this model and a GT-Power/Simulink co-simulation, a deep deterministic policy gradient is developed. To reduce the risk of an unwanted output, a safety filter is added to the deep reinforcement learning. Based on the simulation results, this filter has no effect on the final trained deep reinforcement learning; however, during the training process, it is crucial to enforce constraints on the controller output. The developed safe reinforcement learning is then compared with an iterative learning controller and a deep neural network–based nonlinear model predictive controller. This comparison shows that the safe reinforcement learning is capable of accurately tracking an arbitrary reference input while the iterative learning controller is limited to a repetitive reference. The comparison between the nonlinear model predictive control and reinforcement learning indicates that for this case reinforcement learning is able to learn the optimal control output directly from the experiment without the need for a model. However, to enforce output constraint for safe learning reinforcement learning, a simple model of system is required. In this work, reinforcement learning was able to reduce N O x emissions more than the nonlinear model predictive control; however, it suffered from slightly higher error in load tracking and a higher fuel consumption.",2023,6

We enhance the model by introducing an information fusion function, leading to an information-fusionized estimator model. This model ensures both estimation accuracy and the completeness of FMAV topological information within a unified framework. To facilitate the analysis, each FMAV’s received signal is individually sampled using independent and time-varying samplers. Transforming the received signals into equivalent bounded time-varying delays through the input delay method yields a more manageable and analyzable time-varying nonlinear network error system. Subsequently, we construct a Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) and integrate it with the refined Wirtinger and relaxed integral inequalities to derive design conditions for the FMAVs’ distributed H∞ state estimator, minimizing conservatism. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and superiority of the designed estimator through simulations.",2024,0

Combining this method with model learning, we propose a model-based RL framework with formal stability guarantees, Krasovskii-Constrained Reinforcement Learning (KCRL). We theoretically study KCRL with kernel-based feature representation in model learning and provide a sample complexity guarantee to learn a stabilizing controller for the underlying system. Further, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of KCRL in learning stabilizing policies in online voltage control of a distributed power system.

The network-induced delays are handled via the prediction; thus, the delay value is allowed to be large, and the burden of the network is relieved by the event-triggered input. Two methods are employed to deal with the large delay issue: the state and output feedback. When the state of each subsystem is measurable, full-state feedback is used, whereas when the plant state cannot be measured, output feedback is employed with the help of an observer, which is more common in practice. Instead of treating the interactive plants like a global system, the exponential stability of the coupled systems, under decentralized predictors with asynchronous sampled-data feedback, is analyzed in a decentralized way.

The approach proposed here uses of an “estimate” of the system matrices for the anti-windup compensator formulation and modifies the adaptation laws that update the controller gains. It will be observed that if the (unknown) ideal control gain is reached, a type of “model recovery anti-windup” formulation is obtained. In addition, it is shown that if the ideal control signal eventually lies within the control constraints, then, under certain conditions, the system states will converge to those of the reference model as desired.

It is shown that an optimal selection of the sliding surface and the consequent selection of the nonlinear gain multiplying the “unit control” action, guarantee that sliding mode is achieved after a finite time interval despite the presence of unmatched perturbation. After entering sliding mode, the matched perturbations are fully rejected while the unmatched ones are non amplified. The numerical examples demonstrate the proposed methodologies on a single input nominally unstable plant.",2023,0

Design/methodology/approach A trajectory error compensation method based on admittance-extended Kalman filter (AEKF) error fusion for human–exoskeleton interaction control. The admittance controller is used to calculate the trajectory error adjustment through the feedback human–exoskeleton interaction force, and the actual trajectory error is obtained through the encoder feedback of exoskeleton and the designed trajectory.

However, a drawback of the conventional disturbance observers is that they all assume persistent excitation (PE) of the systems. As a result, they may lead to poor estimation precision when PE is not ensured, for instance, when the disturbance gain of the system is close to the singularity. In this paper, we propose a novel disturbance observer based on concurrent learning (CL) with time-variant history stacks, which ensures high estimation precision even in PE-free cases. The disturbance observer is designed in both continuous and discrete time. The estimation errors of the proposed method are proved to converge to a bounded set using the Lyapunov method. A history-sample-selection procedure is proposed to reduce the estimation error caused by the accumulation of old history samples. A simulation study on epidemic control shows that the proposed method produces higher estimation precision than the conventional disturbance observer when PE is not satisfied.

In this method, the controller is designed using a triggered‐state‐dependent integral sliding mode, which can ensure the robustness and avoid the shortcomings of traditional sliding mode arrival stage. The triggering mechanism utilizes a time‐varying trigger threshold instead of a traditional fixed threshold, which not only realizes the dynamic update of the control law, reduces the overhead of network communication but also ensures that the system trajectory enters the bounded area. The lower bound of inter event time guarantees the avoidance of the Zeno phenomenon. Next, in order to reduce the impact of high‐frequency chattering of the control signal effectively and allow the gain of the discontinuous control term to be adjusted automatically according to the rate of change of the disturbance, a dual‐layer nested adaptive gain scheme based on equivalent control is considered. This scheme does not require a priori boundedness of the disturbance and its rate of change. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, the event‐triggered adaptive sliding mode controller can make the system trajectory converge in finite time and ensure the robustness of the control. Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness and simplicity of this method.",2023,3

Simultaneously employing approximating functions using fuzzy logic systems and incorporating dynamic surface control technology integrated with a first-order filter, the unknown nonlinear functions emanating from the suggested controller strategy are estimated. Additionally, this approach addresses the prevalent problem of complexity explosion observed in conventional backstepping techniques.

Nevertheless, traditional PPC schemes may suffer singularity problems when the expected state constraint is violated. This may cause a decrease in the control effect or even instability of the system. Motivated by this issue, this article proposes a singularity-avoidance PPC scheme (SAPPC) to deal with these problems, of which the core is a shear-mapping-based error transformation procedure that globally transforms the original error state without singularity. Based on the presented nonsingular error transformation, this article presents a perspective to guarantee the satisfaction of given transient performance requirements by leading the state trajectory converging along a preassigned smooth trajectory called reference performance function (RPF). Based on the concept of the RPF, this article naturally adopts an error-defined-type state constraint, providing a time-varying constraint boundary and alleviating the potential overcontrol problem at the steady state. Furthermore, in order to validate the proposed SAPPC scheme, a simple backstepping controller is developed by employing the predefined-time stability technique and the dynamic surface control technique.

The main aim of this paper is to develop a highly effective modified model reference PID controller, tailored to ensure optimal flowrate control of petroleum products throughout their transportation. Initially, the petrol transportation process is analyzed to establish a suitable mathematical model based on vital factors like pipeline diameter, length, and pump attributes. However, using a basic first-order time delay model for petrol transportation systems is limiting due to inaccuracies, variable delay issues, safety oversights, and real-time control complexities.

The aerial robot is based on a quadcopter with a three degree of freedom robotic arm connected to the base of the vehicle. The work aims to create a stable airborne robot with a robotic arm that can work above and below the airframe, regardless of where the arm is attached. Integrating a robotic arm into an underactuated, unstable system like a quadcopter can enhance the vehicle's functionality while increasing instability. To execute a mission with accuracy and reliability during a real‐time task, the system must overcome the inter‐coupling effects and external disturbances. This work presents a novel design for a robust adaptive feedback linearization controller with a model reference adaptive controller and hardware implementation of the quadcopter manipulator system with plant uncertainties. The closed‐loop stability of the aerial robot and the tracking error convergence with the robust controller is analyzed using Lyapunov stability analysis. The quadcopter manipulator system is custom developed in the lab with an off‐the‐shelf quadcopter and a 3D‐printed robotic arm. The robotic system architecture is implemented using a Jetson Nano companion computer for autonomous onboard flight. Experiments were conducted on quadcopter manipulator system to evaluate the autonomous aerial robot's stability and trajectory tracking with the proposed controller.",2023,2

In response to these problems, an extended flight control system for L1 adaptive theory is proposed and rigorously proved. This system involves considering the nonlinear function matrix of state variables, which serves as an extension of the regression matrix in the original L1 adaptive control system, thus enhancing its nonlinear characteristics. The problem of calculating the adaptive laws, caused by the extended regression matrix, is solved by using the pseudo-inverse matrix. To eliminate the transient response, the state vector and its estimate are recorded and employed just like an integrator. Finally, the proposed system is verified on a high-subsonic flight subject to nonlinear uncertainties, with simulation results showing improved control accuracy and enhanced robustness.

Two oxygen concentrations of 100 ppm and 1000 were used during the SLM fabrication of the experimental specimens. The tensile test data revealed a small influence of the oxygen content on the bulk properties. The low oxygen concentration improved the elongation while slightly reduced the ultimate tensile strength and yield stress.

To this end, a variety of modelling techniques for the plethora of the AM mechanisms has been proposed. However, the process modelling complexity, a term that can be used in order to define the level of detail of the simulations, has not been clearly addressed so far. In particular, one important aspect that is common in all the AM processes is the movement of the head, which directly affects part quality and build time. The knowledge of the entire progression of the phenomenon is a key aspect for the optimization of the path as well as the speed evolution in time of the head. In this study, a metamodeling framework for AM is presented, aiming to increase the practicality of simulations that investigate the effect of the movement of the head on part quality. The existing AM process groups have been classified based on three parameters/axes: temperature of the process, complexity, and part size, where the complexity has been modelled using a dedicated heuristic metric, based on entropy. To achieve this, a discretized version of the processes implicated variables has been developed, introducing three types of variable: process parameters, key modeling variables and performance indicators.

It should be noted that achieving the Lyapunov stability of the uncertain systems in the presence of coupled dynamics with discrete-time model reference adaptive control techniques typically result in unavoidable complexity. This makes it difficult to generalize successful continuous-time adaptive control results to discrete-time environments. Thus, this work proposes a model reference adaptive control architecture based on a discrete-time setting to deal with systems in the presence of uncertainties and coupled dynamics. This is achieved by using observer dynamics, where the tracking error between the system state and the reference model is shown to be asymptotically stable using a Lyapunov function composed of logarithmic and quadratic functions. An illustrative example is also presented to show the efficacy of the discrete-time model reference adaptive control architecture over the standard counterpart.",2023,0

In the context of adaptation, model reference adaptive control methods make the state response of the actual plant follow a reference model. In the context of synchronisation, consensus methods involving diffusive coupling induce a collective behaviour across multiple agents. We draw from the understanding about the two time-scale nature of synchronisation motivated by the study of blended dynamics. The synchronisation-oriented approach consists in the design of a coupling input to achieve desired closed-loop error dynamics followed by the input allocation process to shape the collective behaviour. We suggest that synchronisation can be a reasonable design principle allowing a more holistic and systematic approach to the design of adaptive control systems for improved transient characteristics. Most notably, the proposed approach enables not only constructive derivation but also substantial generalisation of the previously developed closed-loop reference model adaptive control method. Practical significance of the proposed generalisation lies at the capability to improve the transient response characteristics and mitigate the unwanted peaking phenomenon at the same time.",2024,0

The aerial robot is based on a quadcopter with a three degree of freedom robotic arm connected to the base of the vehicle. The work aims to create a stable airborne robot with a robotic arm that can work above and below the airframe, regardless of where the arm is attached. Integrating a robotic arm into an underactuated, unstable system like a quadcopter can enhance the vehicle's functionality while increasing instability. To execute a mission with accuracy and reliability during a real‐time task, the system must overcome the inter‐coupling effects and external disturbances. This work presents a novel design for a robust adaptive feedback linearization controller with a model reference adaptive controller and hardware implementation of the quadcopter manipulator system with plant uncertainties. The closed‐loop stability of the aerial robot and the tracking error convergence with the robust controller is analyzed using Lyapunov stability analysis. The quadcopter manipulator system is custom developed in the lab with an off‐the‐shelf quadcopter and a 3D‐printed robotic arm. The robotic system architecture is implemented using a Jetson Nano companion computer for autonomous onboard flight. Experiments were conducted on quadcopter manipulator system to evaluate the autonomous aerial robot's stability and trajectory tracking with the proposed controller.",2023,2

The de-oiling technology based on the hydrocyclones system connected to the three-phase separator is generally employed for the PW treatment. In order to boost the effectiveness of the interconnected de-oiling systems, it is crucial to introduce an advanced coordinated controller for the separators and hydrocyclone systems with regard to the uncertainties and unknown disruptions that occur during dynamic operations. This research suggests a robust Multivariate Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) approach, in order to regulate the Pressure-Drop-Ratio (PDR) of the hydrocyclone and the water level in the separator simultaneously. The suggested control technique is expressed within a framework of state feedback output tracking MRAC by taking adaptive disturbance rejection into account. Furthermore, a control parametrizing obtained from a factorization of the High-Frequency Gain Matrix (HFGM) in the shape of the product of three matrices, i.e. LDS decomposition, is employed in the designing procedure to relax restrictive conditions about the HFGM.

It should be noted that achieving the Lyapunov stability of the uncertain systems in the presence of coupled dynamics with discrete-time model reference adaptive control techniques typically result in unavoidable complexity. This makes it difficult to generalize successful continuous-time adaptive control results to discrete-time environments. Thus, this work proposes a model reference adaptive control architecture based on a discrete-time setting to deal with systems in the presence of uncertainties and coupled dynamics. This is achieved by using observer dynamics, where the tracking error between the system state and the reference model is shown to be asymptotically stable using a Lyapunov function composed of logarithmic and quadratic functions.

The cost function is defined as the sum of contributions calculated in the grid points and it is minimized under the constraint that expresses the dynamic model of the controlled system. The control force calculated only for one step of the horizon is exerted, and the next horizon is redesigned from the measured initial state to avoid the accumulation of the effects of modeling errors. In the suggested solution, the dynamic model is directly used without any gradient reduction by using a transition between the gradient descent and the Newton–Raphson methods to achieve possibly fast operation. The optimization is carried out for an ""overestimated"" dynamic model, and instead of using the optimized force components the optimized trajectory is adaptively tracked by an available approximate dynamic model of the controlled system. For speeding up the operation of the system, various cost functions have been considered in the past. The operation of the method is exemplified by simulations made for new cost functions and the dynamic control of a 4-degrees-of-freedom SCARA robot using the simple sequential Julia language code realizing Euler integration.",2022,3

In this regard, the multiple-model methodology has been beneficial over the past couple of decades. However, the application of this methodology requires proven indirect model reference adaptive control. Such a gap exists in the case of discrete-time linear time-invariant systems with unknown parameters. The principal contribution of this paper is to fill this void by arriving at proof of global stability of discrete-time adaptive systems that use the prediction error rather than the control error to update the parameters of the prediction model. This proof is based on the theory of Lyapunov and the properties of square-summable sequences. An analysis of the available literature reveals that such a result is not available even for linear time-invariant systems. Therefore, the proof is first provided for adaptive systems with a single prediction model wherein the transfer function of the plant has an arbitrary relative degree. Subsequently, this proof is extended to the case of multiple prediction models in the context of multiple-model methodology with second-level adaptation. Two parameter update algorithms are considered. Simulation studies are included to demonstrate the improvement in transient performance.",2021,3

One way of dealing with them is to apply the Command Governor scheme, which changes the controller’s reference to enforce constraints. When the system is a switched one, the problem of stability arises. Switched systems are a common kind of system used to describe non-linear systems by dividing them into linear sections or different modes of operations of the same system, like the different phases an airplane goes through during take-off or landing. However, arbitrarily switching the modes of a switched system can cause instability, requiring a switching rule design. The most commonly used rule is the dwell-time switch, in which the system waits for a dwell-time to elapse after the references changes to switch modes. Seeing the possibility of speeding up such systems’ convergence, we propose a new rule based on the controller’s Region of Attraction, which requires the system’s state to be inside the mode’s controller’s Region of Attraction to switch, guaranteeing stability after a mode switch. With this technique, we also propose a hybrid switch technique, which can further speed up convergence and generate lower actuator effort in some cases. We present some simulations to illustrate the proposal’s potential and compare it with a scheme exploiting a dwell-time approach.

When a model of the system is available, barrier certiﬁcates have been successfully applied for ensuring the satisfaction of safety speciﬁcations. In this work, we formulate the computation of barrier certiﬁcates as a robust convex program (RCP). Solving the acquired RCP is hard in general because the model of the system that appears in one of the constraints of the RCP is unknown. We propose a data-driven approach that replaces the uncountable number of constraints in the RCP with a ﬁnite number of constraints by taking ﬁnitely many random samples from the trajectories of the system. We thus replace the original RCP with a scenario convex program (SCP) and show how to relate their optimizers. We guarantee that the solution of the SCP is a solution of the RCP with a priori guaranteed conﬁdence when the number of samples is larger than a pre-computed value. This provides a lower bound on the safety probability of the original unknown system together with a controller in the case of synthesis. We also discuss an extension of our veriﬁcation approach to a case where the associated robust program is non-convex and show how a similar methodology can be applied. Finally, the applicability of our proposed approach is illustrated through three case studies.",2021,7

The proposed architecture employs three key components for each agent; a nonlinear reference model, a weight update rule, and an adaptive control signal. Predicated on agent-wise reference model state exchange, an ideal finite-time behaviour of overall multiagent system is captured by nonlinear reference models. The weight update rule of each agent, which is driven by a local error signal between the actual uncertain state of an agent and its reference model state, then adjusts agent-wise controller parameters in real-time to drive the local error signals of each agent to zero in finite-time. That is, not only the states of agents converge to their nonlinear reference model states in finite-time, but also the latter states converge to the given ideal behaviour in finite-time. Considering safety, the distinct feature of our architecture is that it does not rely on agent-wise actual state exchange between agents, which involves the effect of system uncertainties. This implies that when a subset of agents exhibits, for example, Byzantine behaviour, then their behaviour do not affect the rest of multiagent system from functioning.",2022,1
"402f9caccd953dcc1a5c243b9e60461391a9b33d","Robust Fuzzy Control for Uncertain Nonlinear Power Systems","This paper presents a new control technique based on uncertain fuzzy models for handling uncertainties in nonlinear dynamic systems. This approach is applied for the stabilization of a multimachine power system subject to disturbances. In this case, a state-feedback controller based on parallel distributed compensation (PDC) is applied for the stabilization of the fuzzy system, where the design of control laws is based on the Lyapunov function method and the stability conditions are solved using a linear matrix inequalities (LMI)-based framework. Due to the high number of system nonlinearities, two steps are followed to reduce the number of fuzzy rules. Firstly, the power network is subdivided into sub-systems using Thevenin’s theorem. Actually, each sub-system corresponds to a generator which is in series with the Thevenin equivalent as seen from this generator. This means that the number of sub-systems is equal to the number of system generators. Secondly, the significances of the nonlinearities of the sub-systems are ranked based on their limits and range of variation. Then, nonlinearities with non-significant variations are assumed to be uncertainties. The proposed strategy is tested on the Western systems coordinating council (WSCC) integrated with a wind turbine. The disturbances are assumed to be sudden variations in wind power output. The effectiveness of the suggested fuzzy controller is compared with conventional regulators, such as an automatic voltage regulator (AVR) and power system stabilizers (PSS).",2022,1

The key feature of the proposed framework is that it guarantees asymptotic convergence between the trajectories of an uncertain dynamical system and a given reference model without relying on any measurements from the coupled dynamics under a tight sufficient stability condition.

One way of dealing with them is to apply the Command Governor scheme, which changes the controller’s reference to enforce constraints. When the system is a switched one, the problem of stability arises. Switched systems are a common kind of system used to describe non-linear systems by dividing them into linear sections or different modes of operations of the same system, like the different phases an airplane goes through during take-off or landing. However, arbitrarily switching the modes of a switched system can cause instability, requiring a switching rule design. The most commonly used rule is the dwell-time switch, in which the system waits for a dwell-time to elapse after the references changes to switch modes. Seeing the possibility of speeding up such systems’ convergence, we propose a new rule based on the controller’s Region of Attraction, which requires the system’s state to be inside the mode’s controller’s Region of Attraction to switch, guaranteeing stability after a mode switch. With this technique, we also propose a hybrid switch technique, which can further speed up convergence and generate lower actuator effort in some cases. We present some simulations to illustrate the proposal’s potential and compare it with a scheme exploiting a dwell-time approach. The results suggest that our approach adds new CG and supervisor design possibilities, reducing the transition time between system modes and improving the closed-loop performance indexes.",2021,0

Under the effect of partial shading (PS), the PV curve has many local maximum peaks (LMPs) and one global maximum peak (GMP) which is dynamic because it changes with time when the shading pattern (SP) changes. The traditional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methods are unable to track the Dynamic GMP and may fall into one of the LMPs. Many modern MPPT methods have been introduced that can track the Dynamic GMP, but their effectiveness can be improved. In this respect, this work introduces a new optimal MPPT technique to enhance the performance of the maximum power point tracking of solar cells under environmental changes and partial shading conditions. The proposed technique combines three well-known and important MPPT techniques, which are the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Variable Step Perturb and Observe (VSP&O), and Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). Artificial Neural Network gives a voltage near the optimum voltage, Variable Step Perturb and Observe updates the voltage to get close to the optimum voltage, and Fuzzy Logic Controller updates the step size of the (P&O) technique. The proposed hybrid ANN-VSP&O-FLC technique showed its ability to track the Dynamic GMP accurately and quickly under the variation in the shading patterns with time and its ability to follow maximum power efficiently and quickly under climate changes. The proposed hybrid ANN-VSP&O-FLC technique also showed very low distortions in waveforms and very low oscillations around the steady state. The proposed hybrid ANN-VSP&O-FLC technique was compared to the most recent and effective MPPT techniques in terms of steady-state behavior, tracking speed, tracking efficiency, and distortions in waveforms, and the comparison showed that it is superior to them, with lower distortions in waveforms, a faster tracking speed (less than 0.1 s), higher tracking efficiency (greater than 99.65%), and lower oscillations around the steady state (less than 2 Watts).",2023,4

Through theoretical stability analysis of the closed-loop system, it is revealed that the UDE-based control is subject to a limited selection range of the filter parameter $T_{f}$ when designed without considering the actuator dynamics. Specifically, an explicit inequality is derived for $T_{f}$ with respect to the feedback gains and actuator parameter, implying that a lower bound may exist on the value of $T_{f}$. In practice, the filter parameter determines the bandwidth of UDE and plays an important role in the disturbance rejection performance.

The objective is to develop a systematic design approach based on a proven technique that provides improved time response and robust steady-state performance of the control system, so as to reduce the burden of trial-and-error procedures. The design of the inner loops of the UAV autopilot is formulated as an optimization problem where the GA is used to determine the weights of the RSLQR synthesis.

The performance of the proposed control design approach is evaluated using analytical tools for linear systems, software-in-the-loop simulations, and Monte Carlo campaigns.

The redundancy of control surfaces provides the possibility for the control system to reconfigure the control law when actuator faults occur during flight. Possible actuator faults have been classified into two categories: predictable and unpredictable faults, and a different strategy has been adopted to deal with each kind of fault. Firstly, the predictable faults are handled by a multiple-model switching adaptive scheme. These kinds of faults are modeled, and their corresponding controllers are derived offline. Secondly, since the degree of drop in aerodynamic effectiveness cannot be predicted a priori, unpredictable faults are handled by a simple adaptive control scheme, to force the plant with faults to track the prescribed reference model. The presented methodology has been verified by nonlinear full-envelope flight simulation for both categories of actuator faults. The predictable fault is represented by the elevator floating. Elevator damage causing an aerodynamic effectiveness drop by 80% is chosen as the example of unpredictable fault. Both faults are simulated at the late stage of the tiltrotor conversion mode. Results show that the presented strategy of reconfiguration is able to detect the fault rapidly and stabilize the aircraft when a fault occurs, while the aircraft motion diverges without the reconfiguration scheme. The aircraft also presents a relatively good performance under controller reconfiguration with a well-tracked conversion path.",2023,1

Because of these vehicles’ aerodynamic complexities and their unique methods of producing thrusts and torques, control allocation is needed to determine how to distribute force and torque efforts across the aircraft’s actuators. However, current control allocation methods fail to properly represent the actuators’ complex dynamics and are unable to harness the full potential of these over-actuated vehicles. Current shortcomings include modeling rotors as linear effectors while the wide range of airspeeds experienced by eVTOL aircraft leads to significant nonlinearities in the thrust and torque achieved by each rotor. This means linear control allocation methods may consistently fail to produce desired thrusts and torques, which can inhibit the vehicle from tracking a trajectory at best, and at worst can cause the vehicle to stall and lose control. Additionally, current control allocation methods are often unable to prioritize low-energy actuators resulting in shorter battery life. We present a nonlinear control allocation method that considers a nonlinear rotor model, allows for prioritization of low-energy control surfaces over rotors, and reliably accounts for actuator saturation. Simulation results show a 90% reduction in high-airspeed trajectory tracking position error from a typical, linear least-squares pseudoinverse control allocation method while maintaining comparable energy use.",2022,0

Two types of dynamic risk maps are introduced as Contingency Risk Map that includes the probability of observing a contingency onboard and Risk Severity Map which covers various sources of data such as population density, a dense air traﬃc, obstacles, terrain, no-ﬂy zones, and so forth. Contingency Risk Map is to quantify the probability of having a contingency and decide if the quantiﬁed probability is above the threshold. If the contingency risk probability is at unacceptable limit, Risk Severity Map assists to select a pre-deﬁned secure emergency landing zone or non-secure emergency landing zone deﬁned onboard. The developed risk assessment structure is tested through two diﬀerent use cases. First one is about deﬁning locations as vertiport alternatives based on the generated map, in case of a contingency ending up with an AAM vehicle to do emergency landing.

The methodology for pre-flight replanning phase is analyzed and modeled in two steps as optimization based potential conflict resolution and demand capacity balancing, which respectively provides safety for the surrounding traffic and efficiency for the traffic network in case of a contingency. These two models can work iteratively to achieve pre-flight replanning for the Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM).

For the use cases, a very large UTM traffic network is considered to have a highly dense traffic environment since the expected complexity is high with the AAM system and to show the efficiency and scalability of the models. Two use cases are examined. First one is about initial flight planning where the conflicted flight plans are safely separated and balance in demand and capacity at vertiports is provided. Second scenario is related to potential conflict resolution for the flights at pre-tactical phase after contingency events observed within the network and demand-capacity balancing after safety related events are resolved.

This necessitates an approach to identify the safety requirements for the increasingly autonomous system (IAS) as well as a framework and techniques to verify and validate that an IAS meets its safety requirements. We use Crew Resource Management techniques to identify requirements and behaviors for safe human-machine teaming behaviors. We provide a methodology to verify that an IAS meets its requirements. We apply the methodology to a case study in Urban Air Mobility, which includes two contingency scenarios: unreliable sensor and aborted landing. For this case study, we implement an IAS agent in the Soar language that acts as a copilot for the selected contingency scenarios and performs takeoff and landing preparation, while the pilot maintains final decision authority. We develop a formal human-machine team architecture model in the Architectural Analysis and Design Language (AADL), with operator and IAS requirements formalized in the Assume Guarantee REasoning Environment (AGREE) Annex to AADL. We formally verify safety requirements for the human-machine team given the requirements on the IAS and operator.

In it, I first want to explain what the problem is and then derive from there the different needs for governance. In a third section, I will refer to the broad IGLUS framework, and highlight what one might be able to learn from the IGLUS experience for the governance of urban airspace. Abstract: Based on the available literature and a number of interviews conducted with some of the important stakeholders, the aim of this contribution is to provide a short introduction to the evolving concept of Urban Air Mobility (UAM), providing some context, a brief overview of the state of play and an outlook focussing on the potential benefits as well as the role of cities with regard to a UAM ecosystem. Abstract: The need for alternative transport solutions in cities and advancements in drone technologies have recently paved the way for the revival of the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) industry. Even if on-demand helicopter services have a long history, urban air has never been a topic discussed in the past as it has been during the last decade. Increasing populations in urban areas, traffic congestion on the ground, and the lack of alternative transport solutions are some of the incentives for the tech companies which have incrementally invested in research and development activities for urban air transport vehicles and their ecosystem. There have been many pilot projects in different cities worldwide, and the debate for realizing the concept, especially in passenger transport, is more heated. This short article intends to give an overview of where we stand in terms of UAM and elaborate more on what can be expected in the medium and long run. Abstract: This article aims to briefly discuss the state of play in urban air mobility (UAM) through the examples of Singapore and Hamburg. Both cities experimented with sandbox projects – UAM laboratories – in an attempt to identify problems and solutions on the way to implementing urban air mobility.

To ensure sustainability, drone services must be safe, comfortable, and not disturb local communities too much. Accidents are detrimental to trust and increase insurance costs.

One way of dealing with them is to apply the Command Governor scheme, which changes the controller’s reference to enforce constraints. When the system is a switched one, the problem of stability arises. Switched systems are a common kind of system used to describe non-linear systems by dividing them into linear sections or different modes of operations of the same system, like the different phases an airplane goes through during take-off or landing. However, arbitrarily switching the modes of a switched system can cause instability, requiring a switching rule design. The most commonly used rule is the dwell-time switch, in which the system waits for a dwell-time to elapse after the references changes to switch modes. Seeing the possibility of speeding up such systems’ convergence, we propose a new rule based on the controller’s Region of Attraction, which requires the system’s state to be inside the mode’s controller’s Region of Attraction to switch, guaranteeing stability after a mode switch. With this technique, we also propose a hybrid switch technique, which can further speed up convergence and generate lower actuator effort in some cases. We present some simulations to illustrate the proposal’s potential and compare it with a scheme exploiting a dwell-time approach. The results suggest that our approach adds new CG and supervisor design possibilities, reducing the transition time between system modes and improving the closed-loop performance indexes.",2021,0

The delay in the measurement of the speed and position signal of SRM is caused by the factors that affect the measuring sensor. To effectively improve the influence of the SRM rotor position and speed signal delay on the system performance, a sliding mode position tracking method based on output delay observation was proposed in this study. First, the model was discretized according to the structure and characteristics of SRM and the mathematical parameters of the system were identified using a multi-innovation stochastic gradient (MISG) algorithm. Second, a delay state observer was constructed on the basis of an SRM system model with output delay. Then, the sliding mode tracking control method based on the delay state observation compensation was proposed and combined with sliding mode control theory. Lastly, the effectiveness of the designed model parameter identification, delay state observation, and output delay control methods were compared through numerical simulation. Results show that when uncertain factors, such as noise, are present in the system, the MISG identification method can rapidly and accurately identify the parameters of the SRM model compared with the stochastic gradient identification method; the identification accuracy of the former is four times higher than that of the latter. Similarly, the sliding mode position tracking control method based on output delay observer can rapidly and accurately track the position and speed within 0.5 s. However, its position (0.2 rad) and velocity (0.233 rad/s) tracking exhibit large steady-state errors when no delay observation compensation is present. The proposed method not only demonstrates high position tracking accuracy, but also possesses strong robustness to output delay.",2020,0

In this paper, through a state transformation, the system can be easily transformed into a system without the time-varying input delay; the appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals are used to compensate the unknown time-varying delay terms, and the quadratic functions instead of the quartic functions often utilized in the existing results are used as Lyapunov functions to analyze the stability of systems and the hyperbolic tangent functions are introduced to deal with the Hessian terms. Fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) in Mamdani type are used to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. Then, based on the backstepping technique, the adaptive fuzzy controller is designed. The three main advantages of the developed scheme are that (i) unlike the existing results which deal with the nonlinearly parameterized functions by using the separation principle, the nonlinearly parameterized functions are lumped into the continuous functions which can be approximated by using the FLS; (ii) the number of the adjusted parameters only depend on the order of the investigated systems, which can reduce the computational burden greatly; and (iii) the existence of the time-varying input delay such that the controller design becomes much more difficult, and in this paper, it can be dealt with by using an appropriate state transformation. It is proven that all the signals of the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded in probability, whereas the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin.

However, the magnitude of steady-state errors and multiple overshoots due to environmental disturbances leads to motion instability. These conditions make the quadrotor experience a shift and even change direction from the reference path. As a result, to minimize steady-state error and multiple overshoots, this study employs a Linear Quadratic Regulator control method with the addition of an Integrator. Comparisons between LQR without Integrator and LQR with Integrator were performed. They were implemented on a quadrotor controller to track square and zig-zag waypoint patterns. From experimental results, LQR without Integrator produce of 2 meters steady-state error and -1.04 meters undershoot average with an accuracy of 64.84 % for square pattern, along 3.19 meters steady-state error, and -1.12 meters undershoot average with an accuracy of 46.73 % for a zig-zag way.

Long-term missions involving aerial vehicles present significant challenges due to the limitations of current battery solutions. Tethered vehicles can circumvent such restrictions by receiving their power from an element on the ground such as a ground station or a mobile terrestrial platform. Tethered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can also be applied to load transportation achieved by a single or multiple UAVs. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review, with a special focus on solutions published in the last five years (2017–2022). It emphasizes the key characteristics that are capable of grouping publications by application scope, propulsion method, energy transfer solution, perception sensors, and control techniques adopted. The search was performed in six different databases, thereby resulting in 1172 unique publications, from which 182 were considered for inclusion in the data extraction phase of this review. Among the various aircraft types, multirotors emerged as the most widely used category. We also identified significant variations in the application scope of tethered UAVs, thus leading to tailored approaches for each use case, such as the fixed-wing model being predominant in the wind generation application and the lighter-than-air aircraft in the meteorology field. Notably, the classical Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) control scheme emerged as the predominant control methodology across the surveyed publications. Regarding energy transfer techniques, most publications did not explicitly describe their approach. However, among those that did, high-voltage DC energy transfer emerged as the preferred solution.

"77ed6e8887a4e7eb112885b558084f39a94865d8","Flight trajectory optimization of Fly-Gen airborne wind energy systems through a harmonic balance method","Abstract. The optimal control problem for flight trajectories of Fly-Gen airborne wind energy systems (AWESs) is a crucial research topic for the field, as suboptimal paths can lead to a drastic reduction in power production. One of the novelties of the present work is the expression of the optimal control problem in the frequency domain through a harmonic balance formulation. This allows the potential reduction of the problem size by solving only for the main harmonics and allows the implicit imposition of periodicity of the solution. The trajectory is described by the Fourier coefficients of the dynamics (elevation and azimuth angles) and of the control inputs (onboard wind turbine thrust and AWES roll angle). To isolate the effects of each physical phenomenon, optimal trajectories are presented with an increasing level of physical representation from the most idealized case: (i) if the mean thrust power (mechanical power linked to the dynamics) is considered as the objective function, optimal trajectories are characterized by a constant AWES velocity over the loop and a circular shape. This is done by converting all the gravitational potential energy into electrical energy. At low wind speed, onboard wind turbines are then used as propellers in the ascendant part of the loop; (ii) if the mean shaft power (mechanical power after momentum losses) is the objective function, a part of the potential energy is converted into kinetic and the rest into electrical energy. Therefore, the AWES velocity fluctuates over the loop; (iii) if the mean electrical power is considered as the objective function, the onboard wind turbines are never used as propellers because of the power conversion efficiency. Optimal trajectories for case (ii) and (iii) have a circular shape squashed along the vertical direction. The optimal control inputs can be generally modeled with one harmonic for the onboard wind turbine thrust and two for AWES roll angle without a significant loss of power, demonstrating that the absence of high-frequency control is not detrimental to the power generated by Fly-Gen AWESs.

This update law is complemented with an iterative power take-off (PTO) controller, which adjusts the spooling profile at each iteration to ensure zero net spooling. We present and validate the proposed control approach in both uniform and spatiotemporally varying turbulent flow environments, based on a realistic ocean model detailed in this article. Finally, based on simulation results across a wide range of excitation levels, we perform a simulation-based assessment of convergence properties, comparing these results against bounds derived in the authors’ prior work.",2022,10

The operation of AWES requires a controller for the tethered aircraft/kite module (KM), as well as a controller for the ground station module (GSM). The literature regarding the control of AWES mostly focuses on the trajectory tracking of the KM. However, an advanced control of the GSM is also key to the successful operation of an AWES. In this paper we propose a cascaded control strategy for the GSM of an AWES during the traction or power generation phase. The GSM comprises a winch and a three-phase induction machine (IM), which acts as a generator. In the outer control-loop, an integral sliding mode control (SMC) algorithm is designed to keep the winch velocity at the prescribed level. A detailed stability analysis is also presented for the existence of the SMC for the perturbed winch system. The rotor flux-based field oriented control (RFOC) of the IM constitutes the inner control-loop. Due to the sophisticated RFOC, the decoupled and instantaneous control of torque and rotor flux is made possible using decentralized proportional integral (PI) controllers. The unknown states required to design RFOC are estimated using a discrete time Kalman filter (DKF), which is based on the quasi-linear model of the IM. The designed GSM controller is integrated with an already developed KM, and the AWES is simulated using MATLAB and Simulink. The simulation study shows that the GSM control system exhibits appropriate performance even in the presence of the wind gusts, which account for the external disturbance.",2021,3
"a2de96951be2a03cf26e4f5cb9615f9acf6c1b99","Large-eddy simulation of airborne wind energy farms","Abstract. The future utility-scale deployment of airborne wind energy technologies requires the development of large-scale multi-megawatt systems. This study aims at quantifying the interaction between the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and large-scale airborne wind energy systems operating in a farm. To that end, we present a virtual flight simulator combining large-eddy simulations to simulate turbulent flow conditions and optimal control techniques for flight-path generation and tracking. The two-way coupling between flow and system dynamics is achieved by implementing an actuator sector method that we pair to a model predictive controller. In this study, we consider ground-based power generation pumping-mode AWE systems (lift-mode AWES) and on-board power generation AWE systems (drag-mode AWES). For the lift-mode AWES, we additionally investigate different reel-out strategies to reduce the interaction between the tethered wing and its own wake. Further, we investigate AWE parks consisting of 25 systems organized in 5 rows of 5 systems. For both lift- and drag-mode archetypes, we consider a moderate park layout with a power density of 10 MW km−2 achieved at a rated wind speed of 12 m s−1. For the drag-mode AWES, an additional park with denser layout and power density of 28 MW km−2 is also considered. The model predictive controller achieves very satisfactory flight-path tracking despite the AWE systems operating in fully waked, turbulent flow conditions. Furthermore, we observe significant wake effects for the utility-scale AWE systems considered in the study. Wake-induced performance losses increase gradually through the downstream rows of systems and reach in the last row of the parks up to 17 % for the lift-mode AWE park and up to 25 % and 45 % for the moderate and dense drag-mode AWE parks, respectively. For an operation period of 60 minutes at a below-rated reference wind speed of 10 m s−1, the lift-mode AWE park generates about 84.4 MW of power, corresponding to 82.5 % of the power yield expected when AWE systems operate ideally and interaction with the ABL is negligible. For the drag-mode AWE parks, the moderate and dense layouts generate about 86.0 MW and 72.9 MW of power, respectively, corresponding to 89.2 % and 75.6 % of the ideal power yield. ",2021,5

The problem of computing the optimal reeling speed for the sake of maximizing the average cycle power is considered. The difficulty stems from two aspects: 1) the uncertain, time- (and space-) varying nature of wind speed, which can not be measured accurately, and 2) the need to consider, in the same optimization problem, the different operational phases of the power cycle. A new, model-based approach that solves this problem is proposed. In the design phase, a model of the AWE system is employed to collect data pertaining to the cycle power obtained with various reel-in/reel-out speed pairs, assuming known wind speed. Then, a nonlinear map, identified from these data, is used as cost function in an optimization program that computes the best reel-in and -out speed pairs for each wind speed. Finally, the optimization results are exploited to infer the link between optimal reeling speed and tether force, which are both measured with high accuracy. Such a link is used to design a feedback controller that computes the reeling speed based on the measured tether force, in order to converge on the optimal force-speed manifold. Simulation results with a realistic model illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.",2021,3

Firstly, because, compared to Earth, key energy resources such as solar and wind are weak as a result of very low atmospheric pressure and low solar irradiation. Secondly, because of the harsh environmental conditions, the required high degree of automation, and the exceptional effort and cost involved in transporting material to the planet. Like on Earth, it is crucial to combine complementary resources for an effective renewable energy solution. In this work, we present the results of a design synthesis exercise, a 10 kW microgrid solution, based on a pumping kite power system and photovoltaic solar modules to power the construction and subsequent use of a Mars habitat. To buffer unavoidable energy fluctuations and balance seasonal and diurnal resource variations, the two energy systems are combined with a compressed gas storage system and lithium-sulphur batteries. The airborne wind energy solution was selected because of its low weight-to-wing-surface-area ratio, compact packing volume, and high capacity factor which enables it to endure strong dust storms in an airborne parking mode. The surface area of the membrane wing is 50 m2 and the mass of the entire system, including the kite control unit and ground station, is 290 kg. The performance of the microgrid was assessed by computational simulation using available resource data for a chosen deployment location on Mars.

The system is designed for 7 kW traction power and comprises an inflatable wing with suspended kite control unit that is either tethered to a fixed ground anchor or to a towing vehicle to produce a controlled relative flow environment. A measurement unit was attached to the kite for data acquisition. To predict the generated tether force, we collected input–output samples from a set of well-designed experimental runs to act as our labeled training data in a supervised machine learning setting. We then identified a set of key input parameters which were found to be consistent with our sensitivity analysis using Pearson input–output correlation metrics.

In order to become a viable alternative to other renewable energy technologies, AWE systems are required to fly reliably for long periods of time without manual intervention while being exposed to varying wind conditions. In the present work a methodology is presented, which augments an existing baseline controller with a prediction and prevention methodology to improve the resilience of the controller against these external disturbances. In the first part of the framework, upset conditions are systematically generated in which the given controller is no longer able to achieve its objectives. In the second part, the generated knowledge is used to synthesize a model that predicts upsets beforehand. Eventually, this allows to trigger an avoidance maneuver which keeps the AWE system operational, however, leads to a lower power production.

Subsequently, we simulate the trajectory for two cases of optimality; (a) minimizing the power consumption and (b) minimizing the endurance, during this phase. Choosing the case of minimizing power is more reasonable for our application, as the time interval difference between the two cases is almost 3 seconds only, but with a huge difference in the power consumed.

Most of the studies are limited to the stabilization problem of the steady motions and positions based on the analysis of the model equations within the framework of a linear approximation. One of the urgent problems of the controlled motion mechanics continues to be the problem of using PID controllers in the semi-global and global trajectory tracking of multi-link robotic manipulators in a non-linear statement. Practically, the problem on applicability of PID controllers is little studied taking into account the possible delay in the feedback structure. This paper deals with the trajectory tracking control problem of multi-link robotic manipulators with a delayed feedback. The mathematical simulation of the controlled robotic manipulators is carried out in a nonlinear statement based on the Lagrange equations. The control model can be characterized as a non-linear PID controller with a variable delay in the feedback structure. We use the Lyapunov functional method as well as the limiting equations to prove the asymptotic stability property of the closed-loop system. Sufficient conditions for the trajectory tracking control are defined in the form of restrictions on control parameters and inequalities with respect to the mass-inertial parameters of the system, and admissible delay.

Inspired by large surface machining, many scenarios require hybrid force/position control, and the simple position control can no longer meet the above requirements. Therefore, ABLF‐MFC with a dual‐loop structure is established, which are force sub‐control loop and position sub‐control loop. Based on the idea of admittance control, the force sub‐control loop generates a reference trajectory according to the desired interaction force and trajectory. Then, for the position sub‐control loop, to simplify the controller design process, an ultra‐local model (ULM) is introduced, which can approximate the original system. Since the ULM has an unknown term, time‐delay estimation (TDE) is applied to estimate it, which can also reduce the dependence on accurate model parameters. The position sub‐control loop is designed by an asymmetric time‐varying barrier Lyapunov function, an integral‐type Lyapunov function and an adaptive compensation term, so the tracking error can be kept within the preset boundary while ensuring the convergence, and the TDE estimation error can be compensated.

Considering that the main controller must adapt to the complex working conditions and performance degradation of aero-engines, the multivariable robust model reference adaptive controller based on the augmented Linear Quadratic Gaussian controller, referred to as LQG-MRAC, is proposed to enhance the robustness and adaptability. Besides, a bumpless switching controller is investigated to ensure smooth transferring from the open-loop controller to the main LQG-MRAC controller.

However, their designs predicated on quadratic Lyapunov‐based frameworks are quite intricate due to the resulting complexity in the Lyapunov difference expressions. Therefore, a wide array of available continuous‐time results addressing transient performance issues using adaptive control algorithms cannot be applied or readily extended to the discrete‐time case. In this article, we present a new model reference adaptive control architecture for discrete‐time uncertain dynamical systems. Specifically, the proposed architecture consists of a command governor mechanism that adjusts the trajectory of a given command during the closed‐loop transient response. It is shown that this mechanism is effective in improving transient performance of discrete‐time model reference adaptive control architectures.

Each agent utilizes a distributed model reference adaptive control (MRAC) law to deal with uncertainties. The nominal part of the MRAC is a distributed static state feedback control law. The reference model is the leader‐following consensus problem of reference agents with homogeneous linear time‐invariant dynamics. This problem becomes an N‐player graphical differential game under a given cost function. The reference agents utilize distributed static state feedback controllers that constitute a Nash equilibrium solution to the graphical differential game. This paper provides the conditions for the distributed MRAC to guarantee that each agent asymptotically tracks the corresponding reference agent; consequently, the multi‐agent system solves the leader‐following consensus problem as the reference model does. These conditions yield a straightforward design method for the MRAC. A numerical example demonstrates an application of the proposed approach to a multi‐robot system with nonlinear dynamics.",2023,3

With regard to (1), the distributed adaptive control architecture used in the experiment utilizes a control input having a nominal part and an adaptive augmentation part for each agent to suppress the effect of uncertainties and disturbances effectively. This architecture is capable to provide uniform ultimate boundedness for the output tracking error between each heterogeneous uncertain agent and the leader with unknown dynamics. In addition, if the output of the leader converges to a constant, then the output of each agent asymptotically converges to the output of the leader by this architecture, where the system is subject to matched disturbances and time-invariant system uncertainties over fixed (i.e., time-invariant) and directed graph topology. The experimental setup for validating this architecture is a multiagent mechanical platform composed of two-cart inverted pendulums and a cart. In order to achieve heterogeneity, two carts are attached with different length of pendulums and a cart is used without pendulum. Our mechanical platform involves uncertainties due to friction between pinions of carts and the track. It is observed during the experimental process that the output of agents follow the output of the leader with huge amplitude of oscillations comparing to the control input with adaptive augmentation. This adaptive augmentation minimizes the effect of uncertainties and make the output of agents follow the output of the leader with considerably lower amplitude of oscillations. Several experimental plots are also given to show the efficacy of the proposed distributed adaptive control architecture. We now summarize (2). In contrast to the control architecture used, for example (1), in some reallife scenarios it is not cost-effective to implement a controller into each agent. To address this problem, a proportional integral controller is proposed to implement only one control input into the multiagent system, which is composed of agents executing the distributed information based on the graph topology",2020,0

Each problem with its solutions is concisely summarized below. We consider the cooperative output regulation problem of heterogeneous linear multiagent systems over fixed directed communication graphs. The purpose of this problem is to design a distributed control law such that the overall closed-loop stability is ensured and the tracking error of each agent converges to zero asymptotically for a class of reference inputs and disturbances generated by a so-called exosystem. We investigate the solvability of the problem with internal model-based distributed control laws, namely dynamic state feedback, dynamic output feedback with local measurement, and dynamic output feedback. The approach is twofold: First, the overall closed-loop stability (i.e., global property) is assumed and it is shown, under mild assumptions, that the problem is solved. Second, an agent-wise local sufficient condition is derived to guarantee the global property under standard assumptions. Then, we update the definition of the linear cooperative output regulation problem to allow not only common output synchronization among agents but also an additional output synchronization among a proper subset of the agents for a distributed dynamic state feedback control law that does not exchange its state variables through a communication graph. Similar to the above-mentioned approach, its solvability is investigated by making use of the internal model design from the linear output regulation theory and a small-gain theorem for large-scale interconnected systems. This dissertation also focuses on distributed control of linear multiagent systems with both global and local objectives over fixed directed communication graphs. While the global objective is achieving leaderless synchronization (i.e., consensus) or synchronization to a leader, local objectives for a subset of agents are tasks determined by agent-specific dynamical systems around the synchronization mapping of the global objective. Our main goal is to design a distributed control law such that each agent obeys the global objective when it is not assigned the local task and performs its own local objective otherwise. To",2020,0

Long-term missions involving aerial vehicles present significant challenges due to the limitations of current battery solutions. Tethered vehicles can circumvent such restrictions by receiving their power from an element on the ground such as a ground station or a mobile terrestrial platform. Tethered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can also be applied to load transportation achieved by a single or multiple UAVs. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review, with a special focus on solutions published in the last five years (2017–2022). It emphasizes the key characteristics that are capable of grouping publications by application scope, propulsion method, energy transfer solution, perception sensors, and control techniques adopted. The search was performed in six different databases, thereby resulting in 1172 unique publications, from which 182 were considered for inclusion in the data extraction phase of this review. Among the various aircraft types, multirotors emerged as the most widely used category. We also identified significant variations in the application scope of tethered UAVs, thus leading to tailored approaches for each use case, such as the fixed-wing model being predominant in the wind generation application and the lighter-than-air aircraft in the meteorology field. Notably, the classical Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) control scheme emerged as the predominant control methodology across the surveyed publications. Regarding energy transfer techniques, most publications did not explicitly describe their approach. However, among those that did, high-voltage DC energy transfer emerged as the preferred solution. In summary, this systematic literature review provides valuable insights into the current state of tethered aerial systems, thereby showcasing their potential as a robust and sustainable alternative to address the challenges associated with long-duration aerial missions and load transportation.",2023,3

MHK kite systems are complicated devices that harvest ocean current energy by flying a tethered kite perpendicular to the motion of the current flow. They possess strong coupling between closed-loop flight control, geometric design, and structural design and hence it is important to consider all three facets simultaneously while designing a MHK kite system. Our previous work addressed this problem of simultaneous optimization of plant and controller through a control-aware optimization framework that fuses a geometric optimization tool, a structural optimization tool, and a closed-loop flight efficiency map. While our previous work analyzed the effect of key wing geometric parameters (wingspan and aspect ratio) on the performance of MHK kite systems, the present work represents the next crucial step in the study of ocean energy-harvesting kite systems and expands the design space to include several other wing geometric parameters - airfoil design, wing taper, wing twist, and dihedral angle. The effect of these decision variables on the power-to-mass ratio is estimated through an optimization framework based on a sequential approach. First, using sensitivity analysis, the framework determines which design variables in the design space affect the peak mechanical power generated while flying a cross-current path. In the next step, the combined geometric and structural optimization tool derives optimal values of variables in the reduced design space that results in a minimum structural mass. The constraints in the optimization problem include a lower limit on the peak power and limits on the number and dimensions of I-beam spars and the thickness of the wing shell. With a wing structure that can sustain peak lifting loads equal to less than a fixed value, the rest of the design variables are optimized to achieve maximum time-averaged power using medium-fidelity closed-loop-flight-based simulations.

The path-following controllers investigated are based on a well-known nonlinear guidance logic termed L1 and on a proposed modification of it, which we termed L0. We have developed and implemented both L0 and L1 controllers for an AWES. The two controllers have an easy implementation with an explicit expression for the control law based on the cross-track error, on the heading angle relative to the path, and on a single parameter L (L0 or L1, depending on each controller) that we are able to tune. The L0 controller has an even easier implementation since the explicit control law can be used without the need to switch controllers. Since the switching of controllers might jeopardize stability, the L0 controller has an important theoretical advantage in being able to guarantee stability on a larger domain of attraction.The simulation study shows that both nonlinear guidance logic controllers exhibit appropriate performance when the L parameter is adequately tuned, with the L0 controller showing a better performance when measured in terms of the average cross-track error.",2022,2

The operation of AWES requires a controller for the tethered aircraft/kite module (KM), as well as a controller for the ground station module (GSM). The literature regarding the control of AWES mostly focuses on the trajectory tracking of the KM. However, an advanced control of the GSM is also key to the successful operation of an AWES. In this paper we propose a cascaded control strategy for the GSM of an AWES during the traction or power generation phase. The GSM comprises a winch and a three-phase induction machine (IM), which acts as a generator. In the outer control-loop, an integral sliding mode control (SMC) algorithm is designed to keep the winch velocity at the prescribed level. A detailed stability analysis is also presented for the existence of the SMC for the perturbed winch system. The rotor flux-based field oriented control (RFOC) of the IM constitutes the inner control-loop. Due to the sophisticated RFOC, the decoupled and instantaneous control of torque and rotor flux is made possible using decentralized proportional integral (PI) controllers. The unknown states required to design RFOC are estimated using a discrete time Kalman filter (DKF), which is based on the quasi-linear model of the IM. The designed GSM controller is integrated with an already developed KM, and the AWES is simulated using MATLAB and Simulink.

While energy-harvesting kites can offer more than an order of magnitude more power per unit of mass than traditional fixed turbines, they represent complex flying devices that demand robust, efficient flight controllers and are presented with significant structural loads that are larger with more efficient flight. While significant research has addressed the control problem, a much smaller body of research has addressed plant optimization, with no co-design effort to-date simultaneously addressing the geometry, structure, and control system. In this paper, the geometric and structural optimization is performed in what we term a nested sequential approach to minimize kite mass for a required power output, subject to structural limitations. The optimizer uses a control proxy function formulation to account for the closed-loop flight efficiency differences between different geometric designs, which accounts for plant-controller coupling without requiring explicit consideration of the controller within the geometric/structural tool itself.

Ocean kite systems, which harvest tidal and ocean current resources through high-efficiency cross-current motion, enable energy extraction with an order of magnitude less material (and cost) than stationary systems with the same rated power output. However, an ocean kite represents a nascent technology that is characterized by relatively complex dynamics and requires sophisticated control algorithms. In order to characterize the dynamics and control of ocean kite systems rapidly, at a relatively low cost, the authors have developed a lab-scale, closed-loop prototyping environment for characterizing tethered systems, whereby 3D printed systems are tethered and flown in a water channel environment. While this system has been shown to be capable of yielding similar dynamic characteristics to some full-scale systems, there are also fundamental limitations to the geometric scales and flow speeds within the water channel environment, making many other real-world scenarios impossible to replicate from the standpoint of dynamic similarity. To address these scenarios, we show how the lab-scale framework is used to refine and validate a scalable dynamic model of a tethered system, which can then be extrapolated to full-scale operation.

Economic Iterative Learning Control with Application to Tethered Energy Systems. (Under the direction of Dr. Chris Vermillion.) A multitude of engineered systems in the manufacturing, robotics, and energy systems communities operate in a cyclical or repetitive fashion. The preponderance of traditional tools from repetitive control and its cousin, iterative learning control (ILC), has focused solely on the tracking of a prescribed path. However, many recent and even not-so-recent repetitive processes stand to benefit from control strategies that consider some economic objective (e.g., manufacturing time, metabolic cost, or net energy generation, depending on the application). This dissertation presents two iterative learning control frameworks for repetitive, path-following systems, both of which are tailored to explicitly consider economic performance objectives. In the first, we adapt the update law from traditional ILC so that it applies to the path shape, thereby allowing for the adaptation of the path itself rather than merely tracking a prescribed path. In the second, we adapt the lifted system representation and the update law in order to directly modify control inputs to a system in a way that allows the iteration time to vary from one iteration to the next. These methodologies differ from preexisting work in that they i) allow for optimization of an economic objective, ii) allow the timing properties of a system to vary from one iteration to the next, and iii) do not require that the initial conditions be reset between iterations. Of these contributions, the second and third not only facilitate the consideration of economic performance goals (which are severely hampered by the need to keep iterating timing fixed and reset a system between repetitions) but also amount to lifting fundamental restrictions that are inherent to much of the preexisting work on ILC. The methodologies developed in this work have been validated on a tethered energy system, whereby a high-lift tethered “kite” executes periodic flight patterns that, when optimized, produce more than an order of magnitude more power than an equivalently-sized stationary system. To this end, we present a sequence of four dynamic models of tethered energy systems. These models represent a sequence of incrementally increasingly complexity and realism while also capturing the key elements of the economic optimization problem that are important to this work.

This paper introduces a solution for one of the main challenges of AWE systems, which is the automated reliable launching of the airborne system component. Our launch system configuration consists of a rigid-wing flying object (aircraft) equipped with a VTOL subsystem and launched vertically, with the fuselage also directed vertically. We formulate the Transition phase as an optimal control problem, so as to determine the optimal control inputs which constitute the control surface deflections and the thrust force; which steers the aircraft from hovering with its nose upwards to forward flight. Subsequently, we simulate the trajectory for two cases of optimality; (a) minimizing the power consumption and (b) minimizing the endurance, during this phase. Choosing the case of minimizing power is more reasonable for our application, as the time interval difference between the two cases is almost 3 seconds only, but with a huge difference in the power consumed. We present a detailed mathematical analysis of the system followed by extensive simulation results.",2020,6

In this article, we address the problem of designing a trajectory controller so that such path is closely followed. The path-following controllers investigated are based on a well-known nonlinear guidance logic termed L 1 and on a proposed modiﬁcation of it, which we termed L 0. We have developed and implemented both L 0 and L 1 controllers for an AWES. The two controllers have an easy implementation with an explicit expression for the control law based on the cross-track error, on the heading angle relative to the path, and on a single parameter L ( L 0 or L 1 , depending on each controller) that we are able to tune. The L 0 controller has an even easier implementation since the explicit control law can be used without the need to switch controllers. Since the switching of controllers might jeopardize stability, the L 0 controller has an important theoretical advantage in being able to guarantee stability on a larger domain of attraction.The simulation study shows that both nonlinear guidance logic controllers exhibit appropriate performance when the L parameter is adequately tuned, with the L 0 controller showing a better performance when measured in terms of the average cross-track error.",2022,0

"00bab19cecfdc62132350ea2f4362c025cd0ab0b","Design and Optimisation Framework of a Multi-MW Airborne Wind Energy Reference System","In the present world of conventional wind energy, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 5MW reference wind turbine for offshore system development has become an important piece of the puzzle towards a renewable future based on wind energy. DTU showed the benefit of such a reference model with their 10 MW reference wind turbine and continued the evolution in multi-megawatt wind power systems. Even though these two systems exist in the conventional wind turbine industry, a publicly available reference system does not exist in airborne wind energy. Currently, Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES) are still in the prototype testing phase as no commercial utility-scale product has been released to the market yet. A reference model like the NREL 5MW turbine can therefore significantly increase the speed of AWES development and open a door towards more publicly available research. This thesis solves the following main research question: ""How does a multi-megawatt utility scale airborne wind energy reference system look like, focusing on the main wing parameters?"". This is done by setting up a relatively computationally efficient optimisation framework based on a Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) model combined with a flight dynamics simulation model which can be used in early design optimisations, for example. The FSI model consists of a 3D linear structural Finite Element model coupled with a potential-flow based 3D panel method. The aircraft structure is parametrised and parameters are found for an aircraft with a wing area of approximately 150 m2. The wing mesh and other structural components are created in Matlab while Nastran is exploited to obtain the stiffness, mass and inertia matrices. A model order reduction technique is applied to the structural model, relying on the mode superposition method to decrease the computation effort by several orders. The wing's aerodynamic behaviour is calculated by the 3D panel method. A model order reduction technique is also applied here, based on a Taylor expansion of the aerodynamic influence coefficient matrices. A modified fixed wing aircraft flight controller is used to fly a circular flight path where the ground station periodically allows the tether to be reeled out and in. The navigation of the aircraft is split up in two components, namely the lateral controller (based on a modification to the L1-control logic) and radial dynamics controller (depending on the elevator and tether reel-out behaviour). A Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMAES) optimisation method is applied with a specific objective function to find the system design parameters. This work then presents a detailed representation of the aircraft design, consisting of the planform parameters, material choices and composite layup. It demonstrates the ability of the framework to obtain a wing that can sustain high wing loadings. Also the system performance in a full power cycle illustrates the full potential of a 150 m2 wing which is able to generate multiple megawatts of power. This thesis serves as a foundation of reference systems in airborne wind energy, which other researchers can use and adapt to contribute further to a benchmark network in Airborne Wind Energy.",2019,4

It should be noted that achieving the Lyapunov stability of the uncertain systems in the presence of coupled dynamics with discrete-time model reference adaptive control techniques typically result in unavoidable complexity. This makes it difficult to generalize successful continuous-time adaptive control results to discrete-time environments. Thus, this work proposes a model reference adaptive control architecture based on a discrete-time setting to deal with systems in the presence of uncertainties and coupled dynamics. This is achieved by using observer dynamics, where the tracking error between the system state and the reference model is shown to be asymptotically stable using a Lyapunov function composed of logarithmic and quadratic functions. An illustrative example is also presented to show the efficacy of the discrete-time model reference adaptive control architecture over the standard counterpart.",2023,0

"6c0ed216e9b46fae0d4b2e81a0cbddd9b9f88f5d","On Distributed Control of Multiagent Systems under Adverse Conditions","The objective of this thesis is (1) to show the experimental validation of recently proposed distributed adaptive control architecture for a class of heterogeneous uncertain multiagent systems as well as (2) to theoretically propose a proportional integral controller for multiagent systems having limited resources in the presence of a disturbance with stability analyses. With regard to (1), the distributed adaptive control architecture used in the experiment utilizes a control input having a nominal part and an adaptive augmentation part for each agent to suppress the effect of uncertainties and disturbances effectively. This architecture is capable to provide uniform ultimate boundedness for the output tracking error between each heterogeneous uncertain agent and the leader with unknown dynamics. In addition, if the output of the leader converges to a constant, then the output of each agent asymptotically converges to the output of the leader by this architecture, where the system is subject to matched disturbances and time-invariant system uncertainties over fixed (i.e., time-invariant) and directed graph topology. The experimental setup for validating this architecture is a multiagent mechanical platform composed of two-cart inverted pendulums and a cart. In order to achieve heterogeneity, two carts are attached with different length of pendulums and a cart is used without pendulum. Our mechanical platform involves uncertainties due to friction between pinions of carts and the track. It is observed during the experimental process that the output of agents follow the output of the leader with huge amplitude of oscillations comparing to the control input with adaptive augmentation. This adaptive augmentation minimizes the effect of uncertainties and make the output of agents follow the output of the leader with considerably lower amplitude of oscillations. Several experimental plots are also given to show the efficacy of the proposed distributed adaptive control architecture. We now summarize (2). In contrast to the control architecture used, for example (1), in some reallife scenarios it is not cost-effective to implement a controller into each agent. To address this problem, a proportional integral controller is proposed to implement only one control input into the multiagent system, which is composed of agents executing the distributed information based on the graph topology",2020,0

The current docking control solution for unmanned surface platforms needs to design an automatic tracking–generated trajectory and visual guidance docking system, capable of detecting the connection status after the hook-lock action to ensure a successful connection. However, most of the docking control designs for unmanned surface platforms pay more attention to the first-time success rate but pay less attention to the failures caused by complex and intelligent docking devices or environmental interference during docking. This article proposes a control strategy for autonomous docking and hook locking of two unmanned surface platforms. It guides the active vessel to the side of the passive vessel under the task requirements and triggers the visual docking control algorithm to complete the mechanical connection of the two joints. This method employs an iterative detection mechanism to improve the automatic hook and lock capability of both the active and passive vessels.

Using an integral sliding mode control (ISMC) design based on barrier function (ISMCbf) could improve the robustness of ISMCs. This control scheme, due to the characteristics of the barrier function, can improve the robustness of the proposed controller better than that based on the conventional SMC or integral SMC (ISMC). The ISMCbf scheme exhibits all the benefits of the conventional ISMC with the addition of two main advantages: it does not require prior knowledge of perturbation bounds or their derivatives, and it can effectively eliminate the chattering phenomenon associated with the classical ISMC due to the smooth characteristics of the barrier function. On the other hand, in terms of the design implementation, the ISMCbf is simpler than the ISMC. In this study, the mathematical dynamical model of the VSbW plant was first presented. Then, the control design of the ISMCbf scheme was developed. The numerical results showed that the proposed scheme is superior to the conventional ISMC. The superiority of the proposed ISMCbf controller versus the classical ISM has been evaluated under three different uncertain conditions, and three scenarios can be deduced: a slalom path, quick steering, and shock disturbance rejection.

The proposed robust control scheme is based on the unified barrier function technique that converts the original constrained dynamic positioning system into an equivalent nonconstrained one. In contrast to barrier Lyapunov function-based methods, the unbreakable requirement on the constraints is less restrictive, and the resultant controller is much simpler in this paper. The effect of environmental disturbances is compensated by a double-layer adaptive sliding mode disturbance observer. On the basis of the proposed adaptive disturbance observer, unknown lumped uncertainty can be estimated in finite time without knowing the upper bounds of the derivative of the lumped uncertainty. Since the surface vessel is overactuated, a control allocation scheme is required to distribute the generalized force signal to the actuators.

The challenges associated with the transient performance of adaptive control systems is first addressed using two new approaches that improve the transient performance. Specifically, the first approach is predicated on a novel controller architecture, which involves added terms in the update law entitled artificial basis functions. These terms are constructed through a gradient optimization procedure to minimize the system error between an uncertain dynamical system and a given reference model during the learning phase of an adaptive controller. The second approach is an extension of the first one and minimizes the effect of the system uncertainties more directly in the transient phase. In addition, this approach uses a varying gain to enforce performance bounds on the system error and is further generalized to adaptive control laws with nonlinear reference models. Another challenge in adaptive control systems is to achieve system stability and a prescribed level performance in the presence of actuator dynamics. It is well-known that if the actuator dynamics do not have sufficiently high bandwidth, their presence cannot be practically neglected in the design since they limit the achievable stability of adaptive control laws. Another major contribution of this dissertation is to address this challenge. In particular, first a linear matrix inequalities-based hedging approach is proposed, where this approach modifies the ideal reference model dynamics to allow for correct adaptation that is not affected by the presence of actuator dynamics. The stability limits of this approach are computed using linear matrix inequalities revealing the fundamental stability interplay between the parameters of the actuator dynamics and the allowable system uncertainties. In addition, these computations are used to provide a depiction of the feasible region of the actuator parameters such that the robustness to variation in the parameters is addressed.

The tethered lifting-wing quadcopter has the characteristics of both the kite and tethered multicopter, which has longitudinal stability under suitable design parameters. In this paper, the Euler-Lagrange method is used to build a longitudinal dynamic model of the tethered lifting-wing quadcopter. The equilibrium state under different wind speeds is discussed with the constant of rotor force and pitch angle. Meanwhile, the eigenvalues of the Jacobi matrix in each equilibrium state are analyzed to determine whether the current equilibrium state is statically stable.

Due to the high-dimensional complexity of AWE systems, however, formal mathematical robustness guarantees become difficult to compute. We draw on research from Hamilton–Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis to compute an avoidance control maneuver for the path-following controller that enforces safety constraints on the system while maintaining the guidance strategy. In addition, the subzero level set of the computed value function inherent in HJ reachability analysis indicates the backward reachable set, the set of states from which it is possible to safely drive the system into a target set within a given time without entering undesirable states. Furthermore, to integrate the avoidance controller with the path-following controller, we derive the necessary switching law such that the avoidance maneuver is only initiated when a tether rupture is potentially imminent. We illustrate our results via extensive simulation-based studies.",2022,0

The operation of AWES requires a controller for the tethered aircraft/kite module (KM), as well as a controller for the ground station module (GSM). The literature regarding the control of AWES mostly focuses on the trajectory tracking of the KM. However, an advanced control of the GSM is also key to the successful operation of an AWES. In this paper we propose a cascaded control strategy for the GSM of an AWES during the traction or power generation phase. The GSM comprises a winch and a three-phase induction machine (IM), which acts as a generator. In the outer control-loop, an integral sliding mode control (SMC) algorithm is designed to keep the winch velocity at the prescribed level. A detailed stability analysis is also presented for the existence of the SMC for the perturbed winch system. The rotor flux-based field oriented control (RFOC) of the IM constitutes the inner control-loop. Due to the sophisticated RFOC, the decoupled and instantaneous control of torque and rotor flux is made possible using decentralized proportional integral (PI) controllers. The unknown states required to design RFOC are estimated using a discrete time Kalman filter (DKF), which is based on the quasi-linear model of the IM. The designed GSM controller is integrated with an already developed KM, and the AWES is simulated using MATLAB and Simulink. The simulation study shows that the GSM control system exhibits appropriate performance even in the presence of the wind gusts, which account for the external disturbance.",2021,3

Current commercial prototypes have reached power ratings of up to several hundred kilowatts, and companies are aiming at long-term operation in relevant environments. As consequence, system reliability, operational robustness, and safety have become crucially important aspects of system development. In this study, we analyze the reliability and safety of a 100-kW technology development platform with the objective of achieving continuous automatic operation. We first outline the different components of the kite power system and its operational modes. In the next step, we identify failure modes, their causes, and effects by means of failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) and fault tree analysis (FTA).

This paper introduces a solution for one of the main challenges of AWE systems, which is the automated reliable launching of the airborne system component. Our launch system configuration consists of a rigid-wing flying object (aircraft) equipped with a VTOL subsystem and launched vertically, with the fuselage also directed vertically. We formulate the Transition phase as an optimal control problem, so as to determine the optimal control inputs which constitute the control surface deflections and the thrust force; which steers the aircraft from hovering with its nose upwards to forward flight. Subsequently, we simulate the trajectory for two cases of optimality; (a) minimizing the power consumption and (b) minimizing the endurance, during this phase. Choosing the case of minimizing power is more reasonable for our application, as the time interval difference between the two cases is almost 3 seconds only, but with a huge difference in the power consumed.

"6e35b920ae2da55f59e2feb114d837108b211cba","A methodology for design, analysis and optimization of a vertical take-off system for rigid-wing airborne wind energy systems","Airborne wind energy (AWE) is a new technology aiming at converting wind energy by flying crosswind patterns with a tethered aircraft. One of the main challenges of this technology is the launching and retrieving of the aircraft. A promising solution is the use of a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) system in the form of multiple electrically driven rotors. Contrary to other approaches, such as a rotational and catapult assisted take-off, no detailed studies on a VTOL system for AWE have been conducted so far. The goal of this research is to investigate the opportunities and limitations of a VTOL system as a take-off system for a rigid-wing AWE system (AWES), by designing and simulating a VTOL system for the AP2, an AWES prototype of Ampyx Power B.V. The main research question to be answered by this research is how such a VTOL system can be designed. After having conducted a thorough state-of-the-art analysis (aka. literature study) the main research questions remain and are refined as: 1. What VTOL concept is most suitable for AWE applications? and 2. How do the aerodynamic forces of the AWES effect the VTOL system design? These are addressed and thoroughly analyzed in this report. The proposed and applied design methodology is based on the mass estimation of the VTOL system and its components: motors, battery and rotors. The sizing of the motors and battery is done by calculating the power and energy demand during take-off. Rotor mass is estimated using a statistical model. To calculate the required power, a blade element momentum model (BEM) combined with generalized momentum theory (MT) is used considering both inflow velocity and angle. A flight mechanics model is derived to calculate the required thrust and aircraft attitude. This model considers propulsion, gravity, and aerodynamic forces. A multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO) framework is developed to ensure consistency between the above-mentioned models and to calculate the minimum VTOL system mass for certain wind and operating conditions. A Simulink model of the VTOL system is developed using a multicopter flight path controller and a 2D dynamic model. This simulation model serves as a dynamic feasibility check on the VTOL system design and is used to iterate on assumptions taken in the design model. One of the main findings of this research is that by tilting the rotor depending on wind and flight conditions the minimum VTOL system mass is obtained. The VTOL system mass is estimated at 4.3 kg at wind speeds below 4 m/s and decreases to a mass of 2.1 kg at 10 m/s wind speed. However, for a fixed rotor tilt of -30 degrees (knee-sitter concept, newly introduced in this report), the VTOL system mass is only 100 grams higher for speeds between 5 and 10 m/s. Because a fixed rotor does not require any tilting mechanism, it can be concluded that this concept is most optimal in terms of mass for a direct take-off approach. For the tail-sitter and quad-plane concepts, the VTOL system mass increases with wind speed. A dynamic simulation has proved the feasibility of the sizing results for the tail-sitter, quad-plane and the new knee-sitter concept for a wind speed of 5 m/s and 10 m/s and a target elevation angle of 41.8 degrees. These simulations have shown that, under the assumptions of the simulation, the maximum motor power (from sizing model) is sufficient to successfully fulfill the take-off phase. It is found that the maximum motor power is only used to accelerate the rotor initially. It is not required in the transient flight phases. Furthermore, it is found that the additional power and energy, required for acceleration and transient phases is sufficiently low compared to the safety factor of 1.5 which has been taken into account in the preliminary sizing model.",2020,0

The main challenge lies in how to eliminate the disturbance effect of zero-input responses caused by the switching on the parameter estimation. These responses depend on the unknown states at switching instants (SASI) and constitute an additive disturbance to the parameter estimation, which obstructs parameter convergence to zero. Our solution is to treat the zero-input responses as excitations instead of disturbances. This is realized by first augmenting the system parameter with the SASI and then developing an estimator for the augmented parameter using the \textit{dynamic regression extension and mixing} (DREM) technique. Thanks to its property of element-wise parameter adaptation, the system parameter estimation is decoupled from the SASI. As a result, the estimation errors of system states and parameters converge to zero asymptotically. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed adaptive observer is guaranteed in the presence of disturbances and noise. A numerical example validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",2022,1

In general, fault detection is attained by monitoring the extent of matching between the actual operating condition and an analytical model prediction. This process aids in achieving enhanced performance, and for operating the system within the acceptable bounds. In this article, a neural network‐based classification method and fuzzy‐based control strategy are adapted to perform FDD on a two degree of freedom (2DoF) helicopter system. The operating voltage, pitch, and yaw outputs of the 2DoF helicopter system were considered for developing the algorithm. The signal processing properties of the discrete wavelet transform and pattern recognition properties of a multilayer perceptron neural network are adapted to design the classification algorithm. The developed algorithm improves training and testing efficiency. In order to reinstate the normal operation of the system, the classifier output is integrated with a hybrid fuzzy‐proportional integral derivative controller. This control technique enhances the 2DoF helicopter response as the time taken by the pitch and yaw angle to settle trajectory is reduced. The results depicted validate the efficiency of the projected approach.",2020,4

One way around this problem is to solve it in two steps. This work presents an approach for simultaneously estimating the parameters for PieceWise Autoregressive eXogeneous and PieceWise Output Error models. This is accomplished by using evolutionary algorithms for finding the parameters of the discrete modes (Gaussian mixture models) and employing the proposed weighted and extended least squares algorithm to estimate the ARX or ARMAX submodels. The main advantages of the proposed algorithm are: (i) it can be applied to output error models – which correspond to system with measurement noise, (ii) it is less likely to get trapped in local minima and (iii) it is applicable to problems with large datasets. The proposed approach, which is offline, was validated using simulated and experimental data and was compared with another method from the literature.

However, its weak and easily tuned mechanical properties are still difficult to precisely evaluate, due to the lack of an effective stretching method. In this paper, we propose a force-control-based cyclic loading method for rapidly evaluating the elastic modulus: the E of the microfibers with different GelMA concentrations. A two-tube manipulation system is used to stretch microfiber with a non-destructive process. Based on the model reference adaptive control strategy, the stress response can be fitted into a sinusoidal wave when a small sinusoidal strain is automatically applied onto the microfiber. Afterwards, the maximum tensile stress and tensile stain is obtained to determine the E. Moreover, different stress amplitudes and frequencies are applied to form different stress-strain loops with almost same E. Compared with a frequently-used constant force loading method, the proposed method shows an obvious advantage in measurement accuracy, especially for low-concentration GelMA microfiber. Furthermore, the reasonableness of the measured E for different GelMA concentrations is confirmed by 3D cell culture experiments, and the results show the proposed method has great application potential to investigate the interaction between cell and fibrous bioink substrate.",2022,1

A nonlinear reference model system captures an ideal behavior of the agents for the leader-following consensus problem. We design a modified nonlinear reference model system and propose a distributed model reference adaptive control architecture to suppress the effects of system uncertainties without a strict knowledge of their magnitude and rate upper bounds. Consequently, each agent evolves within a (possibly different) prescribed distance from the corresponding modified reference system trajectories. Based on an input-to-state stability analysis, it is shown that the trajectories of the modified reference model system can get arbitrarily close to the trajectories of the ideal reference model system. As a result, the trajectories of the agents evolve within a user-specified prescribed distance from their ideal system trajectories, satisfying the safety constraints.

Multiple constraints are imposed on the inputs to reduce the fast-varying dynamic effect of the masses to be negligible. Other slow-varying disturbances are precisely estimated by a nonlinear observer. In particular, to resolve the contradiction between the overshoot and the attitude convergence speed, a novel adaptive law is designed based on the smooth hyperbolic tangent function to adjust the convergence parameter within the given boundary.

Because solar sail propulsion is so unique, most research has been focused on developing new mechanical control techniques. However, it can be argued that more advanced control algorithms can be used to mitigate the shortcomings of commonly used control actuators, specifically reaction wheels, when applied to solar sails. This thesis will research how a sliding mode controller compares to a PID controller with respect to settling time and state response error over a range of maximum reaction wheel torque values. The actuator saturation and actuator energy are then compared for two different sliding mode controllers and a PID controller. It was found that the sliding mode controller performed at minimum 14% better in terms of settling time and 7.7% better in terms of state response error, however the PID controller performed 24% better in terms of actuator saturation and energy. Further research should be done to study the potential benefits of sliding mode controllers in terms of their benefits to reduce actuator saturation and energy.",2020,0

Moreover, cost reduction may be vital, hence sensor usage has to be reduced. In the first part of this thesis, to address those restrictions, a model free full state feedback repetitive learning controller which is fused with a one–layer neural network is proposed for robot manipulator which performs a periodic motion. Stability of the system is ensured via Lyapunov based techniques. Numerical simulations and experimental results are introduced to demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller. In the second part of the thesis, under the additional constraint that velocity measurements being unavailable, output feedback repetitive learning controller fused with a neural network term is investigated. The dynamic model of the robot manipulator is again considered as uncertain to avoid its usage as part of the control design, and the reference position vector is still considered to be periodic. The stability of the closed loop system is investigated via Lyapunov based techniques. Numerical simulations are added to demonstrate the proposed controller performance.",2019,0

Compared with a recently proposed method called new modified super-twisting algorithm, in which a linear acceleration factor and a damping factor are added to achieve this goal, the proposed method has several advantages. First, the proposed method enhances the convergence performance of the system by resorting to the characteristics of the conditioned super-twisting algorithm and the adaptive gains, without changing the basic structure of the classical super-twisting controller. Thus, stability proof of this method is much simpler and more concise. Furthermore, unlike the new modified super-twisting algorithm, in which an unnatural assumption on the Lipschitz disturbance is made for the stability proof, this method can counteract not only typical bounded Lipschitz disturbances but also square-root growth disturbances. Also, a set of less conservative control gains can be obtained with the proposed algorithm than with the compared algorithm. Apart from these benefits, several simulation results illustrate that the performance of the proposed method is even better in convergence and recovering from disturbance.",2021,3

Specifically, a manned microsatellite (leader) and a team of autonomous microsatellites (followers) are ordered to cooperate to complete the attitude control task in an optimal way, in which the control strategy and the cost function (or intent) of the leader are unknown to the followers. Based on the differential game (DG) theory, the microsatellites-based attitude takeover control problem is formulated as a cooperative DG, in which each microsatellite has the individual cost function. A key problem is that the followers must infer the leader’s intent first, that is, retrieve the weighting matrix of the cost function of the leader. To achieve this, a composite adaptive law is introduced for each follower to estimate the feedback gain matrix of the leader by using system state data and the cost functions of other followers; based on this, the leader’s intent is inferred online by minimizing a residual error. Then, the cooperative game control law of each follower is designed by itself, and the Pareto equilibrium of the DG system is achieved.

Both the inertia properties and the thruster configuration matrix will change significantly. The unknown dynamics of the partially failed spacecraft also cause a tremendous technical challenge for attitude takeover control. Accordingly, this paper describes a novel reconfigurable control system for postcapture attitude takeover of a partially failed spacecraft with parametric uncertainties, whose fuel has been exhausted or whose actuators have partial malfunctions. First, the reconfigurable control law is designed by command filtering adaptive back-stepping control to guarantee the system performance and global asymptotic stability considering inertia parametric uncertainties. Second, the thrusters are reconstituted, without changing the thruster physical configuration. Finally, the thrusters’ forces can be redistributed by the dynamic control reallocation method based on constrained quadratic programing. Numerical simulations validate the feasibility of the proposed approach for postcapture attitude takeover control of a partially failed spacecraft with parametric uncertainties. Note to Practitioners—This paper presents a methodology for a partially failed spacecraft with parametric uncertainties. It focuses on solving the attitude takeover control of the partially failed spacecraft perfectly, while considering the position and speed constraints of the actuator and avoiding the plume impact to the spacecraft.

Perfect set point tracking is possible by using a cascade-connected inverse and non-inverse transfer function model of the dynamic system. But this method is restricted to the minimum phase system only, whereas, NMP system produces unbounded output response using this inverse model technique. Though, adaptive inverse feed-forward control technique is an effective tracking control system, it also requires an inverse model of the system. To overcome this problem, a novel feed-forward MRAC scheme for the inverse NMP model and the State feedback controller of the non-inverse model has been proposed, and both the controller are decoupled in a 2DOF framework. The feed-forward control technique guaranteed the tracking performance using the Lyapunov stability theory, and the feedback counterpart enhances the steady-state performance of the NMP plant. The robustness of the asymptotic stability as well as tracking performance of the closed-loop NMP system has been ensured by the proposed 2DOF control based MRAC technique.

The autonomy system continuously improves over human action, with minimal intervention, and can take over full-control if necessary. It additively combines user input with an adaptive optimal corrective signal to drive the plant. It is adaptive in the sense that it neither estimates nor requires a model of the human’s action policy, or the internal dynamics of the plant, and can adjust to changes in both. Our contribution is twofold; first, a new controller synthesis for shared control which we formulate as an adaptive optimal control problem for continuous-time linear systems and solve it online as a human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning. The result is an architecture that we call shared linear quadratic regulator (sLQR). Second, we provide new analysis of reinforcement learning for continuous-time linear systems in two parts. In the first analysis part, we avoid learning along a single state-space trajectory which we show leads to data collinearity under certain conditions. In doing so, we make a clear separation between exploitation of learned policies and exploration of the state-space, and propose an exploration scheme that requires switching to new state-space trajectories rather than injecting noise continuously while learning. This avoidance of continuous noise injection minimizes interference with human action, and avoids bias in the convergence to the stabilizing solution of the underlying algebraic Riccati equation. We show that exploring a minimum number of pairwise distinct state-space trajectories is necessary to avoid collinearity in the learning data. In the second analysis part, we show conditions under which existence and uniqueness of solutions can be established for off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous-time linear systems; namely, prior knowledge of the input matrix.",2019,1

Motivated from this standpoint, this paper addresses control synthesis and stability verification for linear time-invariant multiagent systems with heterogeneous actuator dynamics and system uncertainties. We propose a distributed adaptive control architecture in a leader-follower setting for this class of multi-agent systems based on a hedging method, where this method provides correct adaptation when a stability condition based on linear matrix inequalities holds. This condition also reveals the fundamental tradeoff between heterogeneous agent actuation capabilities and unknown parameters in agent dynamics.",2018,1
"6c0ed216e9b46fae0d4b2e81a0cbddd9b9f88f5d","On Distributed Control of Multiagent Systems under Adverse Conditions","The objective of this thesis is (1) to show the experimental validation of recently proposed distributed adaptive control architecture for a class of heterogeneous uncertain multiagent systems as well as (2) to theoretically propose a proportional integral controller for multiagent systems having limited resources in the presence of a disturbance with stability analyses. With regard to (1), the distributed adaptive control architecture used in the experiment utilizes a control input having a nominal part and an adaptive augmentation part for each agent to suppress the effect of uncertainties and disturbances effectively. This architecture is capable to provide uniform ultimate boundedness for the output tracking error between each heterogeneous uncertain agent and the leader with unknown dynamics. In addition, if the output of the leader converges to a constant, then the output of each agent asymptotically converges to the output of the leader by this architecture, where the system is subject to matched disturbances and time-invariant system uncertainties over fixed (i.e., time-invariant) and directed graph topology. The experimental setup for validating this architecture is a multiagent mechanical platform composed of two-cart inverted pendulums and a cart. In order to achieve heterogeneity, two carts are attached with different length of pendulums and a cart is used without pendulum. Our mechanical platform involves uncertainties due to friction between pinions of carts and the track. It is observed during the experimental process that the output of agents follow the output of the leader with huge amplitude of oscillations comparing to the control input with adaptive augmentation. This adaptive augmentation minimizes the effect of uncertainties and make the output of agents follow the output of the leader with considerably lower amplitude of oscillations. Several experimental plots are also given to show the efficacy of the proposed distributed adaptive control architecture. We now summarize (2). In contrast to the control architecture used, for example (1), in some reallife scenarios it is not cost-effective to implement a controller into each agent. To address this problem, a proportional integral controller is proposed to implement only one control input into the multiagent system, which is composed of agents executing the distributed information based on the graph topology",2020,0

In this work the aerodynamic potential of trailing-edge flaps and leading-edge flaps is numerically studied with the purpose to significantly reduce the structural gust loads. The utilized spanwise-segmented flaps represent slight modifications of existing devices for high-lift and maneuvering. The investigations based on unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations are conducted by employing a generic wing–fuselage aircraft configuration at transonic flow conditions. Idealized discrete “[Formula: see text]”-type vertical gusts that are relevant for the certification process are used as representative atmospheric disturbances. The focus of this paper is to introduce a practicable prediction method for required trailing- and leading-edge flap deflections for a significant mitigation of gust-induced wing loads. The three-dimensional flap deflections are determined by parametric two-dimensional simulations at representative wing sections. Different extensions of the estimation approach are investigated to assess the influence of the wing planform, the finite wing span, the aerodynamic phase lags, and the flap scheduling. It is shown that the trailing- and leading-edge flaps are promising in terms of alleviation of gust-induced wing bending and wing torsional moments, respectively. However, at high leading-edge flap deflections that are necessary for a full compensation of the wing torsional moment large-scale flow separation is identified. The introduced gust load alleviation approach indicates a good transferability between two-dimensional airfoil and three-dimensional wing aerodynamics for unsteady flap deflections.",2023,0

This demonstrator integrates the technologies of smart sensing, smart actuation and smart controls using a six module distributed morphing concept. The morphing sequence is brought about by two actuators present at both ends of each of the morphing modules. The deflection estimation is carried out by interrogating optical fibers that are bonded on to the wing’s inner surface. A novel application is demonstrated using this method that utilizes the least amount of sensors for load monitoring purposes. The fiber optic sensor data is used to measure the deflections of the modules in the wind tunnel using a multi-modal fiber optic sensing approach and is compared to the deflections estimated by the actuators. Each module is probed by single-mode optical fibers that contain just four grating sensors and consider both bending and torsional deformations. The fiber optic method in this work combines the principles of hybrid interferometry and FBG spectral sensing. The analysis involves an initial calibration procedure outside the wind tunnel followed by experimental testing in the wind tunnel.

Statistical data shows that fly-by-wire technology with automatic flight control systems can effectively reduce the fatal accident rate of loss of control in-flight. Although the dynamics of an aircraft are nonlinear and time-varying, it is common practice to design flight control laws based on local linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamic models, and apply gain-scheduling method. Here, the flight envelope is divided into many smaller operating regimes, and LTI model-based controllers are designed and tuned for each of them. However, this approach is cumbersome and cannot guarantee flight stability and performance in-between operational points. In view of the challenges encountered by LTI model-based control, nonlinear control methods have attracted attention from the flight control community. Nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) and backstepping (BS) are two frequently used nonlinear control methods in flight control. These two approaches cancel the nonlinearities in the closed loop using a nonlinear model of the system. However, mismatches between the model and real dynamics inevitability exist, especially when an aircraft encounters atmospheric disturbances and when sudden actuator faults or even structural damages occur. To enhance the robustness of model-based nonlinear control methods to model mismatches, a commonly adopted approach is to augment them with online model identification. This process, however, is computational intensive and requires sufficient excitation, which can make an impaired aircraft fly out of the diminished safe flight envelope. In consideration of these challenges, the main goal of this thesis is: To design a stability-guaranteed nonlinear flight control framework with reduced model dependency and enhanced robustness.",2019,1

The challenges associated with the transient performance of adaptive control systems is first addressed using two new approaches that improve the transient performance. Specifically, the first approach is predicated on a novel controller architecture, which involves added terms in the update law entitled artificial basis functions. These terms are constructed through a gradient optimization procedure to minimize the system error between an uncertain dynamical system and a given reference model during the learning phase of an adaptive controller. The second approach is an extension of the first one and minimizes the effect of the system uncertainties more directly in the transient phase. In addition, this approach uses a varying gain to enforce performance bounds on the system error and is further generalized to adaptive control laws with nonlinear reference models. Another challenge in adaptive control systems is to achieve system stability and a prescribed level performance in the presence of actuator dynamics. It is well-known that if the actuator dynamics do not have sufficiently high bandwidth, their presence cannot be practically neglected in the design since they limit the achievable stability of adaptive control laws. Another major contribution of this dissertation is to address this challenge. In particular, first a linear matrix inequalities-based hedging approach is proposed, where this approach modifies the ideal reference model dynamics to allow for correct adaptation that is not affected by the presence of actuator dynamics. The stability limits of this approach are computed using linear matrix inequalities revealing the fundamental stability interplay between the parameters of the actuator dynamics and the allowable system uncertainties. In addition, these computations are used to provide a depiction of the feasible region of the actuator parameters such that the robustness to variation in the parameters is addressed. Furthermore, the convergence properties of the modified reference model to the ideal reference model are analyzed. Generalizations and applications of the proposed approach are then provided.

"98252733630f4ffdbb1e6cdc5ccb8b22171a3fd2","Control of Uncertain Dynamical Systems with Spatial and Temporal Constraints","The overarching objective of this dissertation is the development of feedback control frameworks for uncertain dynamical systems that are subject to spatial and/or temporal constraints. These spatiotemporal constraints usually arise from the physical and/or performance characteristics associated with a considered dynamical system in safety-critical applications, where synthesis and analysis of feedback control laws are not trivial. Specifically, the proposed control architectures in this dissertation mainly contribute to the model reference adaptive control and finite-time control literature. In particular, unlike existing model reference adaptive control approaches that are not capable of enforcing user-defined performance guarantees without an ad-hoc tuning process, the proposed control architectures utilize an error-dependent learning rate that enables a control designer to assign a user-defined performance bound to the system trajectories. In addition, the convergence time of the existing finite-time controllers either depends on the initial conditions of the system or the upper bound on the system uncertainties; hence, this convergence time cannot be strictly assigned by the control designer. The proposed finite-time control algorithms in this dissertation utilize a time transformation technique to address this challenge, where the resulting convergence time is independent of the initial conditions and the knowledge of upper bound of the system uncertainties. Research in adaptive control theory has demonstrated the capabilities of these feedback algorithms in suppressing the effects of adverse conditions resulting from exogenous disturbances, imperfect system modeling, degraded modes of operation, and changes in system dynamics. Yet, not only standard adaptive controllers usually yield to conservative performance bound on the system error signal, but also they require the knowledge of the upper bound on the system uncertainties to specify such a bound. Therefore, a major challenge in standard adaptive control algorithms is their inability to address control problems with a-priori given spatial constraints. In this dissertation, this critical issue is addressed by introducing the set-theoretic model reference adaptive control architecture. This approach utilizes so-called generalized restricted potential functions by incorporating a system error-dependent learning rate in the adaptation process. The resulting control architecture ensures that the system error signal evolves in a user-defined compact set for",2018,0

It is assumed that the accurate position and velocity information of the trajectory is known only to a subset of manipulators. A two-layer control scheme consisting of an estimation layer and a control layer is developed. At the estimation layer, prescribed-time distributed estimators are designed to estimate the position and velocity of the trajectory. The estimation errors are shown to converge to zero in pre-specified time. At the control layer, an event-driven distributed controller with a dynamic triggering mechanism is proposed, where nonuniform time-varying communication delays are considered. A distinctive feature of the proposed controller is that both control updates and communication occur at certain event instants, and thus control update burden and communication costs are reduced. Moreover, two adaptive time-varying control gains are designed so that the controller can be implemented without requiring any inequality condition or global information. Finally, a simulation platform based on MATLAB Robotics Toolbox is designed and implemented to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed two-layer control scheme.",2023,0

Whereas conventional cooperative manipulation methods require rigid contact points, our approach exploits rolling effects of passive end-effectors and does not require force/torque sensing. The removal of rigidity allows for more modular grasping, increased application to more object types, and online adjustment of the grasp. The proposed control algorithm exhibits the following properties: 1) it is distributed, in the sense that the robotic agents calculate their own control signal, under an event-triggered communication scheme. Such a scheme reduces the interagent communication requirements with respect to continuous communication schemes; 2) it uses an online adaptation mechanism to accommodate for unknown dynamic parameters of the object and the agents and 3) it adapts existing internal force controllers to guarantee no slip throughout the manipulation task despite the event-triggered nature of the communication scheme.

However, the internal stress between the coupled robots leads to deformation in the joints, which results in the deviation of the tool from the manufacturing path. As the state-of-the-art accuracy enhancement techniques are not extended to physically coupled industrial robots, this paper proposes a hybrid position-torque compensation method that improves the path tracking accuracy.

However, when switching faults occur due to parameter errors, the noncentrally synergistic property can lead to the unwinding problem or, in some cases, destabilize the desired set. In this work, a hybrid controller is first proposed based on a novel centrally synergistic family of potential functions on <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mathbb {S}^{n}$</tex-math></inline-formula>, which is generated from a basic potential function through angular warping. The synergistic parameter can be explicitly expressed if the warping angle has a positive lower bound at the undesired critical points of the family. Next, the proposed approach induces a new quaternion-based controller for global attitude tracking. It has three advantageous features over the existing synergistic designs: it is consistent, i.e., free from the ambiguity of unit quaternion representation; it is switching fault tolerant, i.e., the desired closed-loop equilibria remain asymptotically stable even when the switching mechanism does not work; and it relaxes the assumption on the parameter of the basic potential function in the literature.

Maintaining control of pushed objects while avoiding collisions in a tight space demands highly coordinated motion that is challenging to execute on constrained hardware.

Stemming from task-oriented sampling and/or task-oriented demonstrations, e.g., learning based on motion primitives, such trajectories carry additional information often neglected during real-time control deployment. In particular, methods such as probabilistic movement primitives offer the advantage to capture the inherent stochasticity in human demonstrations - which in turn reflects human's understanding about task-variability and adaption possibilities. This information, however, is often poorly exploited and, mostly, used during offline trajectory planning stage. Our work instead introduces a novel real-time motion-generation strategy that explicitly exploits such information to improve trajectories according to changes in the environmental condition and robot task-space topology. The proposed solution is particularly well-suited for bi-manual and coordinated systems where the increased kinematic complexity, tightly-coupled constraints and reduced workspace have detrimental effects on the manipula-bility, joint-limits, and are even capable of causing unstable behavior and task-failure. Our methodology addresses these challenges, and improves performance and task-execution by taking the confidence range region explicitly into account whilst maneuvering towards better configurations. Furthermore, it can directly cope with different closed-chain kinematics and task-space topologies, resulting for instance from different grasps. Experimental evaluations on a bi-manual Franka panda robot show that the method can run in the inner control loop of the robot and enables successful execution of highly constrained tasks.",2022,1

To achieve cooperative task allocation in a distributed way, an adaptation-based estimation law is established for each robotic agent to estimate the desired local trajectory. In addition, wrench synthesis is analyzed in detail to lay a solid foundation for tight cooperation tasks. Together with the estimated task, a set of distributed adaptive (DA) controllers is proposed to achieve motion synchronization of the mobile manipulator ensemble over a directed graph with a spanning tree irrespective of the kinematic and dynamic uncertainties in both the mobile manipulators and the tightly grasped object. The controlled synchronization alleviates the performance degradation caused by the estimation/tracking discrepancy during the transient phase. The proposed scheme requires no persistent excitation condition and avoids the use of noisy Cartesian-space velocities. Furthermore, it is independent from the object's center of mass by employing formation-based task allocation and a task-oriented strategy. These attractive attributes facilitate the practical application of the scheme. It is theoretically proven that convergence of the cooperative task tracking error is guaranteed. Simulation results, as well as manipulation experiments with three mobile manipulators involved, validate the efficacy and demonstrate the expected performance of the proposed scheme.",2018,41

A multi-robot system can take the advantage of increased driving power and more flexible configuration to solve such a problem. However, an increased number of individuals also changed the dynamics of the system which makes control of a multi-robot system more complicated. Even worse, if the whole system is sitting on a centralized decision making unit, the data flow could be easily overloaded due to the upscaling of the system. In this research, we propose a decentralized control scheme on a multi-robot system with each individual equipped with a deep Q-network (DQN) controller to perform an oversized object transportation task. DQN is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, thus does not require the knowledge of system dynamics, instead, it enables the robots to learn appropriate control strategies through trial-and-error style interactions within the task environment. Since analogous controllers are distributed on the individuals, the computational bottleneck is avoided systematically. We demonstrate such a system in a scenario of carrying an oversized rod through a doorway by a two-robot team. The presented multi-robot system learns abstract features of the task and cooperative behaviors are observed. The decentralized DQN-style controller is showing strong robustness against uncertainties. In addition, We propose a universal metric to assess the cooperation quantitatively.",2020,29

Nonlinear dynamics of the unmanned aerial vehicle due to speed variations, as well as variability and uncertainty of the aerodynamic coefficients can be considered as an uncertain model. A robust proportional-integral-derivative controller is designed based on the nonlinear optimization in the time domain for the uncertain nonlinear dynamical model of the unmanned aerial vehicle. Artificial gain and time-delay models are added to achieve required stability margins as system robustness during the robust proportional-integral-derivative control design. The aerodynamic coefficients are divided into two groups on the basis of the output vector's sensitivity to the aerodynamic coefficients. Nonlinear optimization of the criterion is performed in two steps for the robust proportional-integral-derivative controller design. In the first step of the design, nominal values are used for coefficients with low-sensitivity, and upper and lower limits are used only for high sensitive aerodynamic coefficients. In the second step, the upper and lower limits are applied all of the aerodynamic coefficients to evaluate and re-adjust the robust proportional-integral-derivative controller parameters. The robust controller is designed for the uncertain nonlinear roll and lateral dynamic model of the Skywalker X8 flying wing to show the effectiveness of the proposed method to guarantee the stability margins. In the given example during the design of the robust controller, with adding of the artificial gain and time-delay model in the control loop the controller parameters are changed.

Safety, a related property to stability, is becoming increasingly important as the footprint of autonomous systems grows in society. One of the popular ways for ensuring safety is through the notion of a control barrier function (CBF). In this paper, we combine adaptation and CBFs to develop a real-time controller that guarantees stability and remains safe in the presence of parametric uncertainties. The class of dynamic systems that we focus on is linear time-invariant systems whose states are accessible and where the inputs are subject to a magnitude limit. Conditions of stability, state convergence to a desired value, and parameter learning are all elucidated. One of the elements of the proposed adaptive controller that ensures stability and safety is the use of a CBF-based safety filter that suitably generates safe reference commands, employs error-based relaxation (EBR) of Nagumo's theorem, and leads to guarantees of set invariance.

A supervisory control architecture that includes the actions of both a human pilot and an autopilot is proposed to ensure resilient tracking performance in the presence of anomalies. The pilot is tasked with supervisory, higher level decision-making tasks, such as anomaly detection, estimation, and command regulation. The autopilot is assigned a lower level task of accurate command following based on an adaptive control design. The main innovations in the proposed architecture are the use of human pilot in utilizing the concepts of capacity for maneuver (CfM) and graceful command degradation (GCD), both of which originate in cognitive sciences and a judicious combination of the pilot inputs and the autopilot control action. Together, they provide guidelines for a system to be resilient, which corresponds to the system’s readiness to respond to unforeseen events. The supervisory control architecture is shown to be capable of achieving maximum CfM while allowing minimal GCD, as well as satisfactory command following postanomaly, resulting in resilient flight capabilities.

Accommodating nonconstant delays has a strong impact in the predictor construction in terms of the associated transport partial differential equation (PDE) with variable convection speeds beyond the restrictions imposed on the delay regarding its arbitrary duration but bounded variation. A novel predictor design using perturbation-based estimates of the unknown Gradient and Hessian of the map must be introduced to handle this variable nature of the delays, which can arise both in the input and output channels of the nonlinear map to be optimized. Local exponential stability and convergence to a small neighborhood of the unknown extremum point are guaranteed. This technical result is assured by using backstepping transformation and averaging theory in infinite dimensions. Implementation aspects of the presented predictor for variable delays as well as the extension to state-dependent delays are also discussed. At last, we introduce the first results in the topic of extremum seeking control for cascades of transport PDEs that are interconnected through boundary conditions. Such a PDE-PDE cascade is useful to represent simultaneous time- and state-dependent delays.

Finally, the controllers' performances were analyzed and compared. Results obtained showed that both controllers met the desired system performance. With θx is 87.14% and θy is 86.43% less than their respective unregulated settling times, LQR satisfied the at least 80% performance requirement more than LQG. For LQG, θx is 82.35% and θy is 82.95% less than their respective unregulated settling times. These values are less than that of LQR.

It has been proven that CACC aids in the stability and efficiency of traffic flow, and also reduces the energy consumption of the vehicles by lowering air resistance of the following vehicles. However, communication delay is a natural uncertainty for a platoon under CACC mode. When the delay gets worse to a particular level, the string stability of the platoon will be destroyed, meaning spacing or speed errors will be amplified upstream from vehicle to vehicle in the platoon. Therefore, in this study, a numerical method is proposed to identify the communication delay boundary according to the vehicle dynamics and the parameter settings of the CACC controller. First, in the Laplace domain, a series of string stable bodies under different disturbance frequencies are created based on the string stability criteria. Considering the frequency characteristics of traffic flows, the string stable bodies are then combined into a uniform one. Lastly, with the increase of communication delay, its upper bound will be obtained until the area of string stability totally disappears. Two simulations were conducted to verify the correctness and accuracy of the proposed method. The results indicate that the string stability cannot be guaranteed once the communication delay just exceeds the upper bound. This study can provide an objective boundary for practitioners or engineers, thereby allowing them to determine whether wireless inter-vehicle communication is capable of maintaining a string-stable platoon.",2019,17

Connected autonomous vehicles utilise communication systems to enhance the performance of autonomous vehicles and consequently improve transportation by enabling cooperative functionalities, namely, cooperative sensing and cooperative manoeuvring. The former refers to the ability to share and fuse information gathered from vehicle sensors and road infrastructures to create a better understanding of the surrounding environment while the latter enables groups of vehicles to drive in a co-ordinated way which ultimately results in a safer and more efficient driving environment. However, there is a gap in understanding how and to what extent connectivity can contribute to improving the efficiency, safety and performance of autonomous vehicles. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate the potential benefits that can be achieved from connected autonomous vehicles through analysing five use-cases: (i) vehicle platooning, (ii) lane changing, (iii) intersection management, (iv) energy management and (v) road friction estimation. The current paper highlights that although connectivity can enhance the performance of autonomous vehicles and contribute to the improvement of current transportation system performance, the level of achievable benefits depends on factors such as the penetration rate of connected vehicles, traffic scenarios and the way of augmenting off-board information into vehicle control systems.",2018,123

In the cooperative output regulation problem the main purpose consists in achieving reference tracking and disturbance rejection. State-of-the-art methodologies can solve cooperative output regulation only by assuming some critical a priori knowledge: either the exosystem dynamics (e.g. their harmonic frequencies) can be globally shared; or some structural parameters of the communication graph (e.g. structural eigenvalues) are known; or initial stabilizing controllers are available for each system. However, from a practical point of view, it is crucial to develop adaptive methodologies to effectively handle uncertainty in cooperative control of network systems, exploiting as little a priori information as possible. This work addresses and solves the cooperative output regulation problem without exploiting any of the aforementioned critical knowledge. In fact, the distinguishing feature of the proposed solution is to assume an uncertain cooperative scenario where neither follower nor leader dynamics are globally known. In particular, the exosystem dynamics are assumed to correspond to harmonic oscillators with unknown frequencies. Cooperative output regulation is achieved by designing, for each system in the network, fully distributed adaptive controllers, i.e. requiring no knowledge of the structural eigenvalues nor initial stabilizing control law.

The variation in the aerodynamics and model dynamics of these aerial vehicles due to its tilting rotors are the key issues and challenges, which attracts the attention of many researchers. They carry parametric uncertainties (such as non-linear friction force, backlash, etc.), which drives the designed controller based on the nominal model to instability or performance degradation. The controller needs to take these factors into consideration and still give good stability and performance. Hence, a robust H-infinity controller is proposed that can handle these uncertainties.Design/methodology/approachA unique VTOL Quad Tiltrotor hybrid UAV, which operates in three flight modes, is mathematically modeled using Newton–Euler equations of motion. The contribution of the model is its ability to combine high-speed level flight, VTOL and transition between these two phases. The transition involves the tilting of the proprotors from 90° to 0° and vice-versa in 15° intervals. A robust H-infinity control strategy is proposed, evaluated and analyzed through simulation to control the flight dynamics for different modes of operation.FindingsThe main contribution of this research is the mathematical modeling of three flight modes (vertical takeoff–forward, transition–cruise-back, transition-vertical landing) of operation by controlling the revolutions per minute and tilt angles, which are independent of each other. An autonomous flight control system using a robust H-infinity controller to stabilize the mode of transition is designed for the Quad Tiltrotor UAV in the presence of uncertainties, noise and disturbances using MATLAB/SIMULINK.

Quadrotor that flies autonomously will get interference that affects the sensor readings. This condition causes the system cannot reach steady state and requires a long settling time when controlled. Sensory readings error can be reduced using Kalman Filter, but Kalman Filter has heavy computation. So Kalman Filters can be combined with Madgwick quaternion fusion that has light computing. The output of Madgwick quaternion fusion can be optimised for processing using Kalman Filter. Therefore, it takes Madgwick quaternion Kalman Filter approach to reduce read error from the fusion sensor then the result becomes an input state for LQR control to maintain quadrotor balance. The results of this research indicate that quadrotor can overcome the noise and reach steady-state quickly. The system responses show that it takes rise time for 0.4 seconds, 0.3 seconds, and rise time for 1.6 seconds to stabilise roll, pitch, and yaw motion respectively.

If quadrotor is made to have 6 DOF or more (overactuated system), the motion control system to optimise the flight will be different from before. We need to develop overactuated quadrotor control. Quadtiltrotor as the development of quadrotor has some control signal over its DOF. So we call it as an overactuated system. Based on the type of manoeuvre to do, the transition process when the quad tiltrotor performs a translational motion using the tilting rotor need special treatment. The tilt angle change is intended that the quad tiltrotor can perform translational motion while still maintaining its orientation angle near 0°. This orientation angle can change during the undesirable rotational movement as the effect of the transition process. If additional rotational movements cannot be damped, the quad tiltrotor can experience multi overshoot, steady-state error, or even fall. Because of this matter, we need to develop flight control system to handle it. The flight control system of quad tiltrotor can be designed using a model of the system. Models can be created using quad tiltrotor dynamics by the Newton-Euler approach. Then the model is simulated along with the control system using the method of control.

The nonlinear longitudinal mathematical model is constructed in the air wake turbulence condition during carrier landing, which is transformed into a linear perturbed model by the state-space equations with deviation state variables. The concepts of the objective risk and the subjective risk in the recovery of an aircraft aboard a carrier are addressed. A principle of predicting the future states based on the current ones is put forward so that a mathematic model for the objective risk is established, synthetically considering the current and future landing state deviations. For the other risk, the corresponding model is obtained by the subjective experiences of the pilots in the flight simulation tests. Furthermore, a novel model predictive control algorithm, which contains the additional subjective risk and the time-varying weights of the state terms, is proposed. Automatic carrier landing control law is built by introducing the objective risk, the subjective risk, and the effect of carrier air wake disturbance. In the rolling optimization progress, these time-varying weights are dynamically tuned according to the constantly changing objective risk to control the state deviations and suppress this risk, while the subjective risk is handled by the additional risk terms. Besides, the action of carrier air wake disturbance is considered and compensated in the derivation of the linear matrix inequalities. Test results based on a semi-physical simulation platform indicate that the new automatic carrier landing system control algorithm proposed by this article brings about an excellent carrier landing performance as well as an improved flying quality.",2020,6

The control objective is to minimize cumulative NOx and hydrocarbon emissions while limiting visible smoke production and without compromising fuel economy or torque response. This is accomplished by using a supervisory model predictive controller (SMPC) and nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) in tandem. The SMPC controller coordinates the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate target and fuel supplied to the engine in real time to satisfy combustion quality constraints, while the NMPC controller tracks the EGR rate target by manipulating the EGR throttle, EGR valve, and variable geometry turbine. The NMPC controller uses MPC for feedforward and feedback in a novel configuration to simultaneously achieve fast tracking performance, disturbance rejection, and robustness. We demonstrate that the proposed diesel engine MPC controller is able to reduce cumulative emissions by 10% to 15% relative to a state of the art benchmark strategy when placed in closed loop with an engine on a transient dynamometer.",2020,24

Our method falls within the framework of probably approximately correct (PAC) learning. The computed under-approximation comes with statistical soundness provided by the underlying PAC learning process. Such a set, which we call a PAC under-approximation, is obtained by computing a PAC model of the black-box system with respect to the specified safety specification. In our method, the PAC model is computed based on the scenario approach, which encodes as a linear program. The linear program is constructed based on the given family of input samples and their corresponding outputs. The size of the linear program does not depend on the dimensions of the state space of the black-box system, thus providing scalability. Moreover, the linear program does not depend on the internal mechanism of the black-box system, thus being applicable to systems that existing methods are not capable of dealing with.

This variance-based metric forms the basis of active sampling algorithms that aim to minimize prediction error through careful selection of simulations.

However, the nonlinearity of the resulting closed-loop system complicates verification that the system does in fact satisfy those requirements at all possible operating conditions. While analytical proof-based techniques and finite abstractions can be used to provably verify the closed-loop system's response at different operating conditions, they often produce conservative approximations due to restrictive assumptions and are difficult to construct in many applications. In contrast, popular statistical verification techniques relax the restrictions and instead rely upon simulations to construct statistical or probabilistic guarantees. This work presents a data-driven statistical verification procedure that instead constructs statistical learning models from simulated training data to separate the set of possible perturbations into ""safe"" and ""unsafe"" subsets. Binary evaluations of closed-loop system requirement satisfaction at various realizations of the uncertainties are obtained through temporal logic robustness metrics, which are then used to construct predictive models of requirement satisfaction over the full set of possible uncertainties. As the accuracy of these predictive statistical models is inherently coupled to the quality of the training data, an active learning algorithm selects additional sample points in order to maximize the expected change in the data-driven model and thus, indirectly, minimize the prediction error. Various case studies demonstrate the closed-loop verification procedure and highlight improvements in prediction error over both existing analytical and statistical verification techniques.",2017,11

Data from two different experiments were used to train and validate the LSTM classifier, including investigating effects of several key data preprocessing settings. The model correctly classifies human control behavior (cross-experiment validation accuracy 96%) using short 1.6-s data windows. To achieve this accuracy, it is found crucial to scale/standardize the input feature data and use a combination of input signals that includes the tracking error and human control output.

However, existing RL strategies are usually not safe (e.g., can lead to crash) in the initial stage of the training of an RL-based policy. For increasingly complex piloting tasks whose representative models are hard to establish, it is not safe to apply the existing RL strategies to learn an RL-based policy by interacting with an aircraft. To enhance the safety and feasibility of applying an RL-based policy to an aircraft, this study develops an offline–online RL strategy. The offline–online RL strategy learns an effective initialization for an RL-based flight control policy from human pilots without interacting with an aircraft through offline RL. Then, the offline–online RL strategy can further improve the RL-based flight control policy safely without leading to crash by interacting with the aircraft according to regular online RL, requiring no or very little intervention performed by a human pilot. To demonstrate and evaluate the offline–online RL strategy, the strategy is utilized to address the stall recovery problem of aircraft based on a flight simulator.",2023,0

While mathematical models exist for air and space vehicles, they may not fully meet the requirements for expanding control system capabilities. Consequently, the development of data‐based extensions in collaboration with these models becomes crucial to provide specific analysis and synthesis tools in the hybrid realm for practical cases. This article introduces the data‐assisted control (DAC) framework for aerospace vehicles, with the NASA generic transport model serving as the platform for study. By leveraging data, the model‐based controller enhances performance during a damage event. Real‐time decisions are made to update the control law based on information obtained from the data, while the model‐based controller may not exhibit consistent performance. The closed‐loop system is shown to be stable in the transition phase between the data and the model, and robust against uncertainties. The dual unscented Kalman filter is employed to estimate fixed dynamic parameters and generalized force‐moment, and the Koopman estimator is used to estimate the evolution equation of the estimated forces and moments. The dual estimation model ensures observability by considering the persistency of excitation. Simulations have shown that the purely model‐based robust control leads to degradation of the closed‐loop performance in case of damage, suggesting the need for data assistance.

A thin film heat flux sensor is usually fabricated via sputtering, according to different spatial arrangements of thermocouple junctions. A novel thin film heat flux sensor was designed, fabricated, and calibrated, but the connection between the thin film and the leads could not be fixed quickly and steadily. For this purpose, in this paper a method to seamlessly integrate the leads and the thin film has been proposed to improve the sensor output signal. The sensor is capable of simultaneously measuring surface heat flux and temperature magnitude, to address the current situation of the single design of heat flux sensors. The novel thin film heat flux sensor is structured as follows: Thirty pairs of NiCr-NiSi thermocouple junctions are deposited in an annular pattern on a well-designed ceramic substrate. Over the annular thermopile, a 2000 nm-thick thermal insulator layer is deposited to create a temperature gradient across the layers. In addition, in this study a new calibration method was used to evaluate the static and dynamic properties of this novel thin film heat flux sensor. The analysis and experimental results show that the heat flux calculated from the sensor output was in good agreement with the value obtained from the pre-calibrated standard sensor.

Objective In the current study, we investigate whether this impact relates to Type-II spatial disorientation (SD), to motion stimulus magnitude, or to an interaction of these factors. Method Stimuli for participants (n = 23) consisted of Earth-vertical yaw rotations on a rotating chair in a completely darkened room. In the surprise condition, the stimulus started with subthreshold acceleration, followed by suprathreshold deceleration to a non-zero velocity, inducing a sensation of rotation that is opposite to the actual rotation revealed when the lights were switched on. In the no-surprise condition, the same changes in velocity were used, but starting from (almost) zero velocity, which induced a sensation of rotation in the same direction as the actual rotation. Participants performed a self-paced arithmetic task and measurement of their cognitive performance started after the environment was revealed. Stimulus magnitude was operationalized through higher or lower peak suprathreshold deceleration. Results The results revealed that counting speed decreased significantly when participants were surprised, constituting a large effect size. The proportion of counting errors likewise increased significantly when participants were surprised, but only in the high-magnitude condition. Application The findings suggest that surprise caused by the recognition of SD has an involuntary disruptive effect on cognition, which may impact performance of piloting tasks.

However, the false and often nauseating sensations of rotation, by Coriolis effects induced by the centrifuge rotation in combination with rotations of the centrifuge cabin or the pilot's head, are a major disadvantage. This paper discusses the development of a motion filter, the Coherent Alignment Method (COHAM), which aims at reducing Coriolis effects by allowing small mismatches in the G-vector alignment, reducing cabin rotations. Simulations show that as long as these mismatches remain within a region where humans perceive the G-vector as 'coherent', the Coherent Alignment Zone (CAZ), the cabin angular accelerations can indeed be reduced. COHAM was tested in a high G-maneuver task with a fixed CAZ threshold obtained in a previous study. It was experimentally compared to an existing motion filter, using metrics such as sickness, comfort and false cues. Results show that sickness, dizziness and discomfort are reduced, making the centrifuge sessions more bearable.

Based on the integrated model, the particularity of inlet adjustment during deceleration was analyzed. And the analyzed results showed that the inlet regulation is not necessary to keep the inlet and engine working in well-matched at any time under supersonic state. Due to the coupled relationship between inlet and turbofan engine, a new optimal integrated control scheme is proposed in this paper. The inlet ramp angle is taken as an optimal control variable as the same as main fuel mass flow and nozzle throat area.

The helicopter dynamics is represented by a linear state-space model, based on which the feedback control law is designed. Since not all state variables are measurable, state information is acquired by applying a zonotopic Kalman filter to yield sets of state-variable estimates of the helicopter in terms of zonotopes. Not only are the resulting zonotopes used for the observer-based feedback control, but also for estimating the flight envelopes of the helicopter based on the reachability analysis. This approach is useful for enhancing pilot’s awareness about dynamic responses of the helicopter, which may undergo unsafe flight conditions due to actuator faults triggered by undesirable perturbations. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is demonstrated via an example, where we also expose the benefits of applying the zonotopic Kalman filter as compared with an ordinary stochastic Kalman filter.",2021,1

This system consists of two blocks: an observer-based feedback controller and a reachability-based flight envelope estimator. Information about the helicopter’s state is only partially available through measurement. Thus, an element of this system playing an important role to provide information about unmeasurable state variables is an observer, which is then referred to as a zonotopic Kalman filter. Such a Kalman filter is constructed to yield sets of state estimates of the helicopter in terms of zonotopes. Each state-zonotope estimate is defined by a center vector and a generator matrix, which respectively represent a nominal state estimate and possible variations around the center vector. The state-zonotope estimates are utilized by the integrated system to produce control input signals and flight envelope estimates of the helicopter via a zonotopic reachability analysis. The latter is useful for enhancing operator’s awareness about helicopter dynamics, especially when the helicopter suffers from actuator faults. It is well known that the actuator faults may give rise to control effectiveness degradation and accidents in the worst cases. The benefit of applying the zonotopic Kalman filter is shown via an example where noise perturbations upon the helicopter do not possess Gaussian properties. In this case, the zonotopic Kalman filter outperforms an ordinary stochastic Kalman filter in providing meaningful estimates of the helicopter’s state variables.",2020,0

Background The effect of the leans on interpretation errors has previously been demonstrated in nonpilots. In-flight, incorrect assumptions can arise due to misleading roll cues (spatial disorientation). Method Pilots (n = 18) performed 36 runs, in which they were asked to roll to wings level using only the AI. They received roll cues before the AI was shown, which matched with the AI bank angle direction in most runs, but which were toward the opposite direction in a leans-opposite condition (four runs). In a baseline condition (four runs), they received no roll cues. To test whether pilots responded to the AI, the AI sometimes showed wings level following roll cues in a leans-level condition (four runs). Results Overall, pilots made significantly more errors in the leans-opposite (19.4%) compared to the baseline (6.9%) or leans-level condition (0.0%). There was a pronounced learning effect in the leans-opposite condition, as 38.9% of pilots made an error in the first exposure to this condition. Experience (i.e., flight hours) had no significant effects. Conclusion The leans procedure was effective in inducing AI misinterpretations and control input errors in pilots. Application The procedure can be used in spatial disorientation demonstrations. The results underline the importance of unambiguous displays that should be able to quickly correct incorrect assumptions due to spatial disorientation.",2020,6

In order to explore the mechanism of coupling induced flight risk, a method of flight risk assessment based on the stability region of a nonlinear dynamic system was proposed. The Monte Carlo method was improved to identify the boundary of the stability region, and the key parameters that can represent the flight safety were set. The risk quantification method and the colorized flight risk characterization method were proposed. Combined with the case of aircraft encountering icing, the variation trend of flight stability region and flight risk under different icing degrees was calculated. The results showed that with the aggravation of icing, the flight stability region was significantly reduced and the coupling of flight parameters was aggravated. And compared with the traditional angle of attack protection method, this method can find the potential flight risk earlier, and characterize the way of parameters’ coupling and the flight risk evolution process. The proposed method can improve the pilot’s situational awareness, and also provide theoretical support for the prevention of flight risk under adverse conditions, and provide reference for the further development of boundary protection control law.",2020,1

This is suggestive of a perceptual ambiguity in the AI. In the current study, we investigated whether expectation contributes to such misperception. Twenty nonpilots performed tasks in a fixed-base flight simulator. Their expectation about the bank angle was manipulated with a flying task using outside view only. When flying at a bank angle, the outside view disappeared, a moving-horizon type AI was shown, and participants had to roll the wings level, trusting the AI. The AI often matched the previously flown turn. However, in some runs, it showed an opposite bank direction (Opposite condition), which was hypothesized to facilitate a misperception. In some other runs, it showed level flight (Level condition), which should not facilitate this. In a second session, participants rolled wings level without preceding flying task (Baseline condition). Participants made 11.2 times more RREs in the Opposite condition (75% error rate) compared to Baseline condition (6.7%), and 2.5 times more compared to the Level condition (30%). This indicates that RREs were in many cases caused by expectation-induced misperception of the AI bank angle.",2020,2

Although the leans illusion is the most common form of SD, no data exist yet of an effective ground-based leans procedure for a hexapod simulator. In this paper we describe the development of such a procedure and its tuning with nine subjects. The procedure was then used in an experiment with 18 airline pilots, which is described elsewhere. The final procedure started with a prepositioning phase, during which the simulator platform was slowly tilted to a 3.5° prepositioning roll angle, while the pilot performed a distraction task and the instruments and outside visuals indicated level flight. Next followed an adaptation phase, during which the pilot's vestibular system adapted to the new angle, the outside visibility degraded to zero and the instruments were covered. Then the platform was moved back to level, above the perceptual threshold, after which the instruments were shown again. The pilot was then tasked to roll back to level. The addition of the motion cues caused an increase in roll reversal errors by a factor of 3 in airline pilots. The procedure can be implemented in a scenario for demonstrating the leans in a cost-effective simulator.",2020,3

Cela necessite des approches intelligentes pour faire face aux situations d'urgence qui se produiront inevitablement pour toutes les categories d'operations d'UAV telles que definies par l'AESA (Agence europeenne de la securite aerienne). Les limitations materielles de ces petits vehicules suggerent l'utilisation de la redondance analytique plutot que la pratique habituelle de la redondance materielle dans l'aviation humaine. Au cours de cette etude, des pratiques d'apprentissage automatique sont mises en œuvre afin de diagnostiquer les defaillances d'un petit drone a voilure fixe afin d'eviter le fardeau de la modelisation precise necessaire au diagnostic par le modele. Une methode de classification supervisee, SVM (Support Vector Machines), permet de classer les defauts.Les donnees utilisees pour diagnostiquer les defauts sont les mesures de gyroscope et d'accelerometre. L'idee de restreindre le jeu de donnees aux mesures d'accelerometre et de gyroscope est de verifier la capacite de classification de la methode, avec un jeu de puces petit et peu couteux, sans avoir a acceder aux donnees du pilote automatique, telles que les informations d'entree de commande. Ce travail aborde les defauts dans les surfaces de controle d'un UAV. Plus precisement, les defauts consideres sont la surface de controle coincee en angle et la perte d'efficacite.Tout d'abord, un modele d'aeronef est simule. Ce modele n'est pas utilise pour la conception d'algorithmes FDD (Fault Detection and Diagnosis), mais est utilise pour generer des donnees. Des donnees simulees sont utilisees a la place des donnees de vol pour isoler les effets probables du controleur sur le diagnostic, ce qui peut compliquer une etude preliminaire sur les FDD pour les drones. Les resultats montrent que pour les mesures simulees, SVM donne des resultats tres precis sur la classification des defauts de perte d'efficacite sur les surfaces de controle. Ces resultats prometteurs appellent un complement d'investigation afin d'evaluer les performances du SVM en matiere de classification des anomalies avec les donnees de vol. Des vols reels ont ete organises pour generer des donnees de vol erronees en manipulant le pilote automatique open source, Paparazzi. Toutes les donnees et le code sont disponibles dans le systeme de partage de code et de versions, Github. La formation est interrompue en raison du besoin de donnees etiquetees et du fardeau informatique lie a la phase de reglage des classificateurs. Les resultats montrent que, d'apres les donnees de vol, SVM donne un score F1 de 0,98 pour la classification des failles bloquees a la surface de controle. En ce qui concerne les defauts de perte d'efficacite, il est necessaire de recourir a certaines techniques d'ingenierie, impliquant l'ajout de mesures anterieures, pour obtenir les memes performances de classification. Un resultat prometteur est decouvert lorsque les spinors sont utilises comme caracteristiques au lieu de vitesses angulaires. Les resultats montrent qu'en utilisant les spinors pour la classification, la precision de la classification est considerablement amelioree, en particulier lorsque les classificateurs ne sont pas accordes. A l'aide de spinors et d'un noyau Gaussian, un classifieur sans accord donne un score F1 de 0,9555, soit 0,2712 lorsque les mesures gyroscopiques ont ete utilisees. En resume, ce travail montre que SVM donne une performance satisfaisante pour la classification des defauts sur les gouvernes d'un drone a l'aide de donnees de vol.",2019,0

The unprecedented change in aircraft dynamics due to loss of control onset and the associated structural constraints make loss of control prevention and/or recovery a challenging task. State-of-the-art autopilots are generally designed for nominal aircraft operations and disengage under off-nominal conditions, hence cannot be viewed as a safety solution during loss of control onsets. Herein lies the importance of providing training to pilots so as to equip themselves to rescue aircraft from loss of control events. Current pilot training methodologies have significant limitations when it comes to loss of control prevention and recovery strategies. In this context, a simulator for improved pilot training based on bifurcation and continuation techniques is presented in the paper. Augmenting these techniques with the current pilot training procedure can significantly improve the quality of training. This methodology can help pilots to distinguish various loss of control scenarios and aid them in taking appropriate recovery decisions intuitively. Meanwhile, a robust control-based loss of control handling module is also presented for developing non-intuitive strategies for loss of control prevention and recovery. This module can simulate adequate control profiles that the pilot can follow to get in and out of various loss of control scenarios. Moreover, it can be used as pilot activated recovery system in case of pilot disorientation and as a fully autonomous recovery system for much complex scenarios. The simulator is developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK platform and is shown to realize diverse loss of control events like spiral, spin, etc., and subsequent recovery from the same.",2019,3

Rather than relying on statistics alone, this paper concentrates on simulation-based investigation towards various loss of control scenarios and subsequent recovery schemes. Through bifurcation analysis, distinct abnormal dynamics have been identified and their contributions in driving the aircraft towards loss of control have been examined. The effect of steady wind on aircraft dynamics and the evolution of chaotic dynamics as a precursor to loss of control are presented.

Most systems consist of a multi-hole differential pressure sensor or a rotating vane sensor for estimation of AOA, some also require additional data from an Air Data Computer. This paper examines an alternative method for multi-point AOA sensing using COTS MEMS pressure transducers. The method employed multiple chord-wise sensors to measure local pressure and this was used to estimate local AOA for improved stall awareness. The results suggest that the multi-point method is feasible for AOA sensing and can provide local stall warning relative to a local chord airfoil. Expanding the system to span-wise has the potential to improve total stall awareness.

IA systems also enable unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) reaction to anomalies faster than is possible via remote pilot intervention. This dissertation develops autonomous path planning, emergency landing site identification, and risk assessment capabilities applicable to manned and unmanned aviation. The first contribution is to extend existing methods in geometric flight planning to increase the range of an airplane following total loss of thrust. Careful consideration of longitudinal and lateral motion steady flight coupling expands on previous work. A safety-prioritized emergency flight planner considers path feasibility and aircraft envelope to maximize the ability of the aircraft to execute the emergency landing safely. Optimal control is next investigated as an alternative approach for emergency landing planning. Maximum range glide paths obtained from the geometric method are compared with optimal control results. Recoverable sets and reference governors provide feasible transitions between steady-state conditions. Geometric path planners are then adapted to exploit these transition graphs in support of different failure scenarios. Data from sources not previously explored are exploited for optimal emergency landing site selection and approach planning. A method is proposed to identify and assess the risk of road segments that could serve as airplane emergency landing sites exploiting a publicly-available map database. Mining the same detailed map database allows the identification of other areas to serve as emergency landing fields for different UAS platforms. Risk assessment of these areas exploits map and mobile phone data to provide a real-time risk estimate that accounts for time-dependent",2017,3

In this article, we examine the setting where inputs are subject to random noise coming from an arbitrary probability distribution. We propose a robustness certification method that lower-bounds the probability that network outputs are safe. This bound is cast as a chance-constrained optimization problem, which is then reformulated using input–output samples to make the optimization constraints tractable. We develop sufficient conditions for the resulting optimization to be convex, as well as on the number of samples needed to make the robustness bound hold with overwhelming probability.

Existing bridge’s parameters are difficult to estimate precisely and implemented control schemes may perform unsatisfactorily depending on how sensitive they are to parametric change. In this study, an adaptive control approach is developed utilizing the simple adaptive control algorithm and designed aiming to mitigate seismic responses of bridges considering realistic implementation. Adaptive control is a viable alternative to control bridge structures as it is able to calculate control gains that vary over time based on sensed responses, sustaining performance in face of parametric variations. The proposed approach allows the choice of a model reference of significantly low order and it does not require full-state feedback or the use of observers. The effectiveness and robustness of the control approach are investigated when controlling a seismically excited two-span highway bridge considering systematic parametric variations. Evaluation of relevant performance criteria indicates that the adaptive scheme is effective in reducing seismic responses and sustains well the overall performance when systematic parametric variations are introduced. The proposed approach requires a small and reasonable number of sensors to present effectiveness and performs satisfactorily even when in the presence of measurement noise.",2020,7

Among various technologies to mitigate these vibrations, tuned mass dampers with various improvisations, active or semiactive controls, and viscous dampers are proposed and used extensively. Although these technologies are dependent on the frequency of vibration, research on frequency‐independent hysteretic dampers for mitigating wind‐induced vibrations are quite limited. This paper evaluates the efficiency of hysteretic dampers in suppressing wind‐induced vibrations. Inelastic dynamic wind‐load analyses are performed with two regular three‐dimensional buildings and one 76‐story benchmark two‐dimensional building. It is found that hysteretic dampers perform exceedingly better than the state‐of‐the‐art control systems because they can absorb energy near the natural frequencies of the parent structure, as well as within the frequency bandwidth of windstorms.",2019,8

It should be noted that achieving the Lyapunov stability of the uncertain systems in the presence of coupled dynamics with discrete-time model reference adaptive control techniques typically result in unavoidable complexity.

Generally, robots are known by their highly nonlinearities, unmodeled dynamics, and uncertainties. In order to design an optimal control law, based on the linear quadratic regulator, the robotic system is described as a linear time varying model. The compensation of both disturbances and uncertainties is ensured by the integral sliding mode control. The problem of deciding the optimal configuration of the linear quadratic regulator controller is considered as an optimization problem, which can be solved by the application of genetic algorithm. The main contribution of this paper is to consider a multi-objective optimization problem, which aims to minimize not only the chattering phenomenon but also other control performances including the rise time, the settling-time, the steady-state error and the overshoot. For that, a novel dynamically aggregated objective function is proposed. As a result, a set of nondominated optimal solutions are provided to the designer and then he selects the most preferable alternative.

In addition, this approach uses a varying gain to enforce performance bounds on the system error and is further generalized to adaptive control laws with nonlinear reference models. Another challenge in adaptive control systems is to achieve system stability and a prescribed level performance in the presence of actuator dynamics. It is well-known that if the actuator dynamics do not have sufficiently high bandwidth, their presence cannot be practically neglected in the design since they limit the achievable stability of adaptive control laws. Another major contribution of this dissertation is to address this challenge. In particular, first a linear matrix inequalities-based hedging approach is proposed, where this approach modifies the ideal reference model dynamics to allow for correct adaptation that is not affected by the presence of actuator dynamics. The stability limits of this approach are computed using linear matrix inequalities revealing the fundamental stability interplay between the parameters of the actuator dynamics and the allowable system uncertainties. In addition, these computations are used to provide a depiction of the feasible region of the actuator parameters such that the robustness to variation in the parameters is addressed. Furthermore, the convergence properties of the modified reference model to the ideal reference model are analyzed. Generalizations and applications of the proposed approach are then provided.

"898bba28ddf49b2f26739c8e73c31be84116dea9","Online self‐tuning mechanism for direct adaptive control of tall building","The simple adaptive control (SAC) method is known as a remarkable solution to reduce the negative influence of different uncertainties on active control of building structures during an earthquake. The design parameters of this direct adaptive control algorithm are determined after a large number of sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, the selected parameters will not necessarily lead a controller to the optimum performance of the structure. Herein, an innovative online self‐tuning method is firstly introduced to improve the SAC method and cancel out excessive sensitivity analysis. Accordingly, a fuzzy inference system is designed to select the appropriate SAC method, adjusting parameters online instead of using fixed parameters. To show the efficiency of the introduced method, a 20‐story steel building structure equipped with magnetorheological dampers in each story is considered as a benchmark control. The performance of the designed control system is evaluated in different condition of base excitation with and without uncertainty in the model of the proposed structure. The results from the numerical simulations show that the introduced method has better performance than the SAC method with fixed adjusting parameters. The predominance of the method becomes clearer when an input ground motion to the control system has completely different characteristics than the initial designed seismic excitation.",2018,8

Considering sensor fault vectors in nonlinear interconnected systems, this method constructed a generalized nonlinear interconnected system, whose state was designed by augmenting the original system state and fault vectors, which provides a foundation for fault estimation of nonlinear interconnected systems. An augmented observer was developed by equivalent transformation of generalized interconnected system, so as to realize robust estimations of sensor faults in interconnected systems. This estimation method took into account the effect of external disturbance of the system on fault estimation and estimated the convergence speed of error system; the developed method also considered the convenience of solving the gain matrix of the augmented observer, which was beneficial to the realization of sensor fault estimation in interconnected system. The sensor estimation method proposed in the paper has the advantages of robustness in fault estimation,rapidity in error convergence, and convenience in solving the gain matrix. Finally, the state and sensor fault estimation errors of two interconnected systems can both approach 0 within 10 seconds, thus achieving the purpose of fault estimation. Two simulation experiments verified the effectiveness of the proposed fault estimation method and provided a reference for the fault estimation method of nonlinear interconnected systems with disturbance.",2024,0

This new strategy improves the performances of existing methods and ensures better convergence conditions. Sliding window approach involves previous estimated states and measurements in the observer and the control law structures which increase the number of decision variables in the constraint to be solved and offers less restrictive Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) conditions. The established sufficient stability conditions are in the form of Bilinear Matrix Inequality (BMI) which is solved in two steps. First, by using a slack variable technique and an appropriate reformulation of the Young’s inequality. Second, by introducing a useful approach to transform the obtained constraint to a more suitable one easily tractable by standard software algorithms. A comparison with the standard case is provided to show the superiority of the proposed H∞ observer-based controller which offers greater degree of freedom.

In order to stabilize the system and save the occupied communication resources, we propose a model‐based periodic event‐triggered control strategy which can make full use of feedback packets, especially the information contained in their triggering time instants. However, both the network delay and feedback dropouts will reduce the amount of information extracted from triggering/sampling time instants, and significantly degrade the system performance. To handle them, this article provides a novel encoding and decoding method to make use of the timing information and the bits inside each feedback packet for both state and output feedback cases. Compared with the conventional time‐driven strategies, the proposed event‐triggered one can stabilize the concerned nonlinear system at a lower bit rate. The effectiveness and bit rate advantage of the proposed strategy are further illustrated through simulations.",2021,1

The nonlinear unknown input observer (NUIO) was proposed to estimate the system states and actuator faults, and an adaptive sliding mode FTC system was constructed based on it. The gain of the observer and controller is obtained by H∞ optimization and one-step linear matrix inequality (LMI) formula operation in order to realize the overall optimal design of an FTC system. Finally, the experimental results show that when actuator failure occurs, the proposed integrated FE and FTC were more accurate than the decentralized design to estimate the system states and the actuator faults.

Firstly, based on the Luenberger‐like observer, by using the average dwell time approach, sufficient conditions are proposed to make closed‐loop systems be regular, be causal, as having a unique solution, and be uniformly finite‐time bounded. Then, a new linear matrix inequality sufficient condition for the existence of an observer‐based controller is obtained by using certain matrix decoupling techniques, and the controller is designed. In this paper, the conditions proposed not only give the observer‐based controller design methods but also guarantee the existence and uniqueness of solution for the systems. Since the quadratically inner‐bounded nonlinearities are more general than Lipschitz nonlinearities and one‐sided Lipschitz nonlinearities, compared with previous works, the proposed controller design methods in this paper are also more general than the existing ones.

Two FTCC strategies are proposed for two different cases, i.e., leader’s input can be obtained by its neighboring follower agents and the input of the leader is not available by any followers, respectively. In the first case, a distributed observer-based adaptive FTCC protocol is presented to achieve the containment control objective. In the second case, a distributed adaptive FTCC method which is independent of global information about the communication topology and upper bounds of the leader’s input is developed using the local containment error. An auxiliary controller gain is proposed to solve the problem of partial loss of effectiveness faults, and the potential singularity brought by the auxiliary controller gain to the controller can be avoided by introducing a projection operator. It is shown that each follower converges asymptotically to a convex hull spanned by the leaders with external input. Finally, the developed method is demonstrated by simulation results.",2022,32

To this end, one of the effective approaches for tackling the challenge of limited actuator bandwidth is the hedging method in which using a “modified” reference model, the adaptation becomes “excluded” from the actuator dynamics. With this approach, however, the performance bounds between the uncertain dynamical system trajectories and the “ideal” reference model trajectories can be conservative and depend on the bounds on the system uncertainties; therefore, no “practical” performance guarantees exist. To address this challenge, we generalize a recently developed set-theoretic model reference adaptive control architecture, which has the capability to achieve “practical” (i.e., user-defined) performance guarantees, for uncertain dynamical systems subject to actuator dynamics. Specifically, we first show that the proposed architecture keeps the performance bounds between the uncertain dynamical system trajectories and the “modified” reference model trajectories within an a-priori, user-defined bound. We next show that the error bounds between the “ideal” reference model trajectories and the uncertain dynamical system trajectories is characterized by this user-defined bound as well as the actuator bandwidth limit, and hence, is “computable” using a given set of adaptive control design parameters. Finally, as a byproduct, our illustrative numerical example shows that the time rate of change of the actual control signal (i.e., the output of the actuator dynamics) becomes less in magnitude as compared with the the set-theoretic model reference adaptive control case without actuator dynamics.",2018,5

However, considering multiagent systems that consist of agents with heterogeneous actuator capabilities, implementation of distributed adaptive control approaches is not a trivial task. This is due to the fact that each agent in this case cannot identically execute given local control laws and this can lead to a poor networked multiagent system performance or even overall instability. To make the first attempt to this challenging problem, we consider a class of uncertain networked multiagent systems with single integrator dynamics in the context of a leader-follower problem and propose a novel distributed adaptive control design procedure for guaranteeing overall stability in the presence of agents having different actuator bandwidths. Specifically, a distributed adaptive control architecture is implemented for agent uncertainties and a hedging method, which modifies ideal reference models of each agent, is utilized to allow for correct adaptation that does not get affected due to the presence of actuator bandwidths.

The challenges associated with the transient performance of adaptive control systems is first addressed using two new approaches that improve the transient performance. Specifically, the first approach is predicated on a novel controller architecture, which involves added terms in the update law entitled artificial basis functions. These terms are constructed through a gradient optimization procedure to minimize the system error between an uncertain dynamical system and a given reference model during the learning phase of an adaptive controller. The second approach is an extension of the first one and minimizes the effect of the system uncertainties more directly in the transient phase. In addition, this approach uses a varying gain to enforce performance bounds on the system error and is further generalized to adaptive control laws with nonlinear reference models. Another challenge in adaptive control systems is to achieve system stability and a prescribed level performance in the presence of actuator dynamics. It is well-known that if the actuator dynamics do not have sufficiently high bandwidth, their presence cannot be practically neglected in the design since they limit the achievable stability of adaptive control laws. Another major contribution of this dissertation is to address this challenge. In particular, first a linear matrix inequalities-based hedging approach is proposed, where this approach modifies the ideal reference model dynamics to allow for correct adaptation that is not affected by the presence of actuator dynamics. The stability limits of this approach are computed using linear matrix inequalities revealing the fundamental stability interplay between the parameters of the actuator dynamics and the allowable system uncertainties. In addition, these computations are used to provide a depiction of the feasible region of the actuator parameters such that the robustness to variation in the parameters is addressed. Furthermore, the convergence properties of the modified reference model to the ideal reference model are analyzed. Generalizations and applications of the proposed approach are then provided.

These spatiotemporal constraints usually arise from the physical and/or performance characteristics associated with a considered dynamical system in safety-critical applications, where synthesis and analysis of feedback control laws are not trivial. Specifically, the proposed control architectures in this dissertation mainly contribute to the model reference adaptive control and finite-time control literature. In particular, unlike existing model reference adaptive control approaches that are not capable of enforcing user-defined performance guarantees without an ad-hoc tuning process, the proposed control architectures utilize an error-dependent learning rate that enables a control designer to assign a user-defined performance bound to the system trajectories. In addition, the convergence time of the existing finite-time controllers either depends on the initial conditions of the system or the upper bound on the system uncertainties; hence, this convergence time cannot be strictly assigned by the control designer. The proposed finite-time control algorithms in this dissertation utilize a time transformation technique to address this challenge, where the resulting convergence time is independent of the initial conditions and the knowledge of upper bound of the system uncertainties. Research in adaptive control theory has demonstrated the capabilities of these feedback algorithms in suppressing the effects of adverse conditions resulting from exogenous disturbances, imperfect system modeling, degraded modes of operation, and changes in system dynamics. Yet, not only standard adaptive controllers usually yield to conservative performance bound on the system error signal, but also they require the knowledge of the upper bound on the system uncertainties to specify such a bound. Therefore, a major challenge in standard adaptive control algorithms is their inability to address control problems with a-priori given spatial constraints. In this dissertation, this critical issue is addressed by introducing the set-theoretic model reference adaptive control architecture.

In the context of adaptation, model reference adaptive control methods make the state response of the actual plant follow a reference model. In the context of synchronisation, consensus methods involving diffusive coupling induce a collective behaviour across multiple agents. We draw from the understanding about the two time-scale nature of synchronisation motivated by the study of blended dynamics. The synchronisation-oriented approach consists in the design of a coupling input to achieve desired closed-loop error dynamics followed by the input allocation process to shape the collective behaviour. We suggest that synchronisation can be a reasonable design principle allowing a more holistic and systematic approach to the design of adaptive control systems for improved transient characteristics. Most notably, the proposed approach enables not only constructive derivation but also substantial generalisation of the previously developed closed-loop reference model adaptive control method. Practical significance of the proposed generalisation lies at the capability to improve the transient response characteristics and mitigate the unwanted peaking phenomenon at the same time.",2024,0

High adaptive gains are usually needed in order to achieve fast adaptation. However, this leads to high-frequency oscillation in the control signal and may even make the system unstable. A robust adaptive control architecture was designed in this paper for nonlinear aircraft dynamics facing the challenges of input uncertainty, matched uncertainty, and unmatched uncertainty. By introducing a robust compensator to the MRAC framework, the high-frequency components in the control response were eliminated.

Speciﬁcally, our problem formulation considers that inner loop control laws use a model reference adaptive control approach to suppress the eﬀect of system uncertainties such that the overall physical system operates close to its ideal behavior as desired in the presence of adverse conditions due to failures and/or modeling inaccuracies. Moreover, we consider that the outer loop control laws exist owing to employing either sequential loop closure and/or high-level guidance methods. As it is true in practice, in addition, humans are considered to inject commands directly to the outer loop dynamics in response to the changes in the physical system, where the outer loop commands aﬀect inner loop dynamics in response to the commands received from the humans as well as in response to the changes in the physical system. The presence of humans can result in system instability, even when the resulting physical system augmented with inner and outer feedback control loops yield to stable trajectories in the absence of humans. This paper addresses this problem by proving a suﬃcient stability condition for the overall physical system with human dynamics modeled as a linear time-invariant system with human reaction time-delay, where this condition does not depend on system uncertainties similar to our recent theoretical results. Furthermore, inner loop system errors during the transient phase of adaptively suppressing system uncertainties can severely aﬀect the human-outer loop interactions. We also address this issue by utilizing a recently proposed set-theoretic model reference adaptive control approach at the inner loop for enforcing a user-deﬁned performance constraint on the norm of the system error trajectories, where we show how the selection of this constraint aﬀects the overall physical system. Finally, the eﬃcacy of our results is demonstrated through an illustrative numerical example for an adaptive ﬂight control application with a Neal-Smith pilot model.",2019,4

These spatiotemporal constraints usually arise from the physical and/or performance characteristics associated with a considered dynamical system in safety-critical applications, where synthesis and analysis of feedback control laws are not trivial. Specifically, the proposed control architectures in this dissertation mainly contribute to the model reference adaptive control and finite-time control literature. In particular, unlike existing model reference adaptive control approaches that are not capable of enforcing user-defined performance guarantees without an ad-hoc tuning process, the proposed control architectures utilize an error-dependent learning rate that enables a control designer to assign a user-defined performance bound to the system trajectories. In addition, the convergence time of the existing finite-time controllers either depends on the initial conditions of the system or the upper bound on the system uncertainties; hence, this convergence time cannot be strictly assigned by the control designer. The proposed finite-time control algorithms in this dissertation utilize a time transformation technique to address this challenge, where the resulting convergence time is independent of the initial conditions and the knowledge of upper bound of the system uncertainties. Research in adaptive control theory has demonstrated the capabilities of these feedback algorithms in suppressing the effects of adverse conditions resulting from exogenous disturbances, imperfect system modeling, degraded modes of operation, and changes in system dynamics. Yet, not only standard adaptive controllers usually yield to conservative performance bound on the system error signal, but also they require the knowledge of the upper bound on the system uncertainties to specify such a bound. Therefore, a major challenge in standard adaptive control algorithms is their inability to address control problems with a-priori given spatial constraints. In this dissertation, this critical issue is addressed by introducing the set-theoretic model reference adaptive control architecture. This approach utilizes so-called generalized restricted potential functions by incorporating a system error-dependent learning rate in the adaptation process. The resulting control architecture ensures that the system error signal evolves in a user-defined compact set for",2018,0

The thrust of each rotor is controlled to realize 3D linear motion and yaw rotation. Limited by the maximum thrust of each rotor, the saturation phenomenon happens when the control inputs are large. This phenomenon is especially obvious in situations where the quadrotor is flying at a high speed while rotating yaw at the same time for sensing purpose. In these situations, yaw rotation can usually be assigned with a lower control priority compared to linear motions to guarantee the tracking accuracy of the flight trajectory. In this paper, an anti-saturation controller is proposed to improve linear motion tracking performance in these yaw-low-priority flights. By deriving from the dynamic model of the quadrotor, sufficient conditions to realize accurate linear motion control without saturation are presented. An efficient thrust mixer is then derived by considering collective thrust, roll, and pitch first and yaw later. Finally, a complete flight controller is established and released as an open-source repository. To evaluate the performance of the proposed controller, experiments were conducted to compare the tracking error with the popular PX4 flight controller. Results show that when the yaw angle is planned to rotate very fast, the average tracking error of linear motion increases by 188.1% with the PX4 controller while only 79.9 % with our controller.",2021,0

In addition, the presence of input constraints violates the affine property which, as a result, adds additional challenges and complicates designing the control system for quadrotors. In this paper, an adaptive nonlinear control algorithm is designed to overcome these difficulties for small size quadrotors. The proposed algorithm consists of an approximation technique using radial basis function neural network and a modified reference model. This allows the quadrotor to follow a defined path under the presence of external disturbances, actuator saturation and system uncertainties associated with system parameters including mass, inertia and force coefficients. Finally, the stability of the proposed algorithm is proven within the region of interest and validated using simulation.",2017,10

Although government and industry agree on the potential of these algorithms in providing safety and reducing vehicle development costs, a major issue is the inability to achieve a-priori, user-defined performance guarantees with adaptive control algorithms. In this paper, a new model reference adaptive control architecture for uncertain dynamical systems is presented to address disturbance rejection and uncertainty suppression. The proposed framework is predicated on a set-theoretic adaptive controller construction using generalised restricted potential functions.The key feature of this framework allows the system error bound between the state of an uncertain dynamical system and the state of a reference model, which captures a desired closed-loop system performance, to be less than a-priori, user-defined worst-case performance bound, and hence, it has the capability to enforce strict performance guarantees.

"0ecc1ef7d67dae00d8cb2276237c6a09f4363aa3","A model reference adaptive control approach for uncertain dynamical systems with strict component-wise performance guarantees","A critical problem for adaptive control systems is the characterization of the system response during transients. In fact a major issue in adaptive system design is the inability to achieve, a-priori, non-conservative user-defined performance guarantees. At present most of the available analysis tools provide performance bounds depending on the norm of uncertain quantities. Since it is extremely difficult to quantify these quantities, conservative upper bounds are used in their place; these, in turn, produce conservative performance bounds of limited practical utility. To face these problems some of the authors have recently introduced a set-theoretic adaptive controller based on generalized restricted potential functions. The key feature of this approach is that it allows the norm of the tracking error to be less than a-priori userdefined worst-case performance bound, and hence, it has the capability to enforce strict performance guarantees. Since this performance is expressed as function of the norm of the error vector it is not possible to have the direct control on the amplitude of the single error components. In this paper the method is improved by allowing the control of the shape of the performance (ellipsoidal) set that is guaranteed to contain the tracking error trajectories. The design problem is formalized as a linear optimization with LMI constraints that allows specifying independent componentwise requirements for the error components. Different linear optimization cost functions have been evaluated with the purpose of computing the largest ellipsoidal domain contained in an a-priori specified tracking error polyhedral domain and the smallest ellipsoidal domain containing an a-priori specified ellipsoidal initial condition set. A detailed simulation study in the aeronautic context has been used to highlight the efficacy of the method and the role of the different design parameters.",2018,7

Most adaptive control frameworks employ Lyapunov analysis in order to establish stability of the closed loop system. However, the derived signal bounds are inherently conservative. Furthermore, these bounds are seldom known; the plant states might still violate structural requirements, thus causing the system to fail. In order to counter this disadvantage, we employ an adaptive output consistency monitor, which is based on Bayesian linear regression.

Early prior research by the authors has demonstrated that using a projection mechanism for parameters adaptation the tracking error dynamics behaves as a linear system perturbed by bounded uncertainties. This brings the benefit that the stability analysis can be cast in terms of a convex optimization problem with LMI constraints so that efficient numerical tools can be used for the adaptive controller design. A possible limitation of the approach is that the design is restricted to quadratic control Lyapunov functions that could produce a conservative estimation of the regions of operation for the actual uncertain adaptive system. In this paper this approach is extended to arbitrary high degree polynomial Lyapunov functions by translating the design and performance requirements in terms of Sum of Square (SOS) inequalities and then using SOS optimization tools for the design. In this effort the new SOS approach is introduced and compared with the previous one. A numerical example based on the short period longitudinal dynamics of the F16 aircraft is used to demonstrate the efficacy of the novel method.Copyright © 2015 by ASME",2015,0

These spatiotemporal constraints usually arise from the physical and/or performance characteristics associated with a considered dynamical system in safety-critical applications, where synthesis and analysis of feedback control laws are not trivial. Specifically, the proposed control architectures in this dissertation mainly contribute to the model reference adaptive control and finite-time control literature. In particular, unlike existing model reference adaptive control approaches that are not capable of enforcing user-defined performance guarantees without an ad-hoc tuning process, the proposed control architectures utilize an error-dependent learning rate that enables a control designer to assign a user-defined performance bound to the system trajectories. In addition, the convergence time of the existing finite-time controllers either depends on the initial conditions of the system or the upper bound on the system uncertainties; hence, this convergence time cannot be strictly assigned by the control designer. The proposed finite-time control algorithms in this dissertation utilize a time transformation technique to address this challenge, where the resulting convergence time is independent of the initial conditions and the knowledge of upper bound of the system uncertainties. Research in adaptive control theory has demonstrated the capabilities of these feedback algorithms in suppressing the effects of adverse conditions resulting from exogenous disturbances, imperfect system modeling, degraded modes of operation, and changes in system dynamics. Yet, not only standard adaptive controllers usually yield to conservative performance bound on the system error signal, but also they require the knowledge of the upper bound on the system uncertainties to specify such a bound. Therefore, a major challenge in standard adaptive control algorithms is their inability to address control problems with a-priori given spatial constraints. In this dissertation, this critical issue is addressed by introducing the set-theoretic model reference adaptive control architecture.

The objective is to extend the L1 adaptive control framework to cover a wide class of underactuated systems with uniform performance and robustness guarantees. This dissertation starts by investigating some structural properties of multivariable systems that are used in the development of L1 adaptive output feedback controllers. In particular, a state-decomposition is introduced for adaptive laws that only depends on the output signals. The existence of the decomposition is ensured by defining a virtual system for underactuated plants. Based on the mathematical findings, we propose a set of output feedback solutions for uncertain underactuated systems. In adaptive control applications, a baseline control augmentation is often preferred, where the baseline controller defines the nominal system response. Adaptive controllers are incorporated into the control loop to improve the system response by recovering the nominal performance in the presence of uncertainties. This thesis provides a solution for L1 output feedback control augmentation. Stability and transient performance bounds are proven using Lyapunov analysis. To demonstrate the benefits of the L1 adaptive controllers we consider a missile system and an inverted pendulum, which are both underactuated systems.

Although numerous control methodologies have been used for UUVs, adaptive control is considered a promising solution due to its inherent ability to adapt to uncertainty and parameter variations. Nevertheless, it is handicapped by the tradeoff between low adaptive gains and tracking performance. Low gains are preferred to maintain stability and obtain smooth control signals. However, the resulting tracking performance, especially during transients operations, does not allow for precise maneuvering. A possible solution is model reference adaptive control (MRAC) with composite adaptation modification, which uses a prediction error in addition to the tracking error to improve learning without increasing the adaptive gains. Even though this is not a new modification to adaptive control, there is little evidence in the public domain of extensive experimental validations and quantitative analysis under low adaptive gains, especially for underwater operations. Furthermore, newer versions, such as composite MRAC (CMRAC) and predictor-based MRAC (PMRAC), offer several additional advantages. In previous publications, the authors have verified CMRAC and PMRAC for UUVs through computer simulations. Thus, this paper focuses on the experimental validation of CMRAC and PMRAC fitted to a UUV, comparing their performance under normal operations, partial thruster failure, and external disturbances. The results indicate that, while both CMRAC and PMRAC show improvements over MRAC, PMRAC has a substantial advantage over CMRAC and is recommended for future UUV applications.",2020,8

The effect of vehicle's hydrodynamic parameter variations is significant in such scenarios and in extreme conditions the UUV may experience loss of control. In addition, external disturbances and actuator failures degrade the performance of the UUV. Adaptive control has been identified as a promising solution that can improve the performance in such situations. However, adaptive control is not widely used in UUVs mainly due to the trade-off between fast learning and smooth control signals. The latter can be guaranteed at low learning rates but require additional input to improve learning. The Predictor Model Reference Adaptive Control (PMRAC) is one such method that uses a prediction error to improve learning. In this paper, the performance of PMRAC in UUV applications is investigated and compared to standard Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) at low learning rates under normal operational conditions, partial actuator failure, and under the influence of external disturbances.

In addition, the rapid progress in technology has made  UUVs to evolve from the mammoth work- class ROVs to mini and micro ROVs and AUVs. With these  changes in UUVs there has been a parallel evolution of UUV applications culminating in advanced  applications such as operating in cluttered environments in tandem with human divers and being  launched and recovered by underwater docking platforms or naval submarines. Thus future UUV  autonomous control systems must precisely manoeuvre UUVs that are more susceptible to parameter  changes and disturbances while operating under conditions which require large parameter variations.  Adaptive control has been identified as a key enabling technology for all of the above  applications. Although proven to be superior to fixed-gain controllers, adoption of adaptive  control for UUV applications has been lacklustre in the past due to the lack of demanding  applications that justify the added complexity and some inherent limitations. However, it has come  to a point that it is no longer feasible to ignore the benefits of adaptive control for future high  performance, safety critical UUV applications.  Therefore, this thesis is an effort to design and evaluate adaptive control systems for such future  applications. It was identified that to ensure precise manoeuvres throughout the entire operation,  the main focus should be on improving transient tracking without control signal oscillation or  instability. Also, the controllers are required to show sufficient robustness against measurement  noise and time-delay. To this end, three modifications to the standard Model Reference Adaptive  Control (MRAC) architecture that improves transient performance without using high learning rates  were developed for an existing small ROV/AUV. Composite MRAC (CMRAC) and Predictor MRAC (PMRAC)  both use a prediction error in addition to the tracking error to improve transient performance.  Command Governor Adaptive Control (CGAC) uses command signal modification to achieve the same end.  The performance improvements of these architectures were all initially verified using simulations and then validated using experiments. Simulations and experiments were carried out to investigate  transient operations, actuator failures and external disturbances. The acquired data were subjected to a  comprehensive analysis in both time domain and frequency domain to provide a compelling  quantitative evaluation of the different methods.  The results indicated that significant improvements in transient tracking, fault tolerance and  disturbance rejection can be obtained with the proposed solutions, compared to standard MRAC with  minimal additional complexity. The transient tracking performance improvement was achieved while  reducing the high frequencies in the control signal and with less control effort or less energy  usage. It has also been shown that, under partial actuator failures, regulation and tracking task  can still be carried out with negligible variations. In addition several forms of disturbances such  as large impacts, wave disturbances and tether snags are simulated and tested and significant  improvements were observed in reducing maximum deviation, settling time and oscillations at the  output. Furthermore, it is shown that some proposed solutions are able to overcome the actuator  dead-zone without using an additional dead-zone inverse. Also, introduced in this thesis is a novel  adaptive control methodology named Extended CGAC (ECGAC) which increases the robustness to noise  and time-delay while retaining the enhanced performance. In summary, the feasibility of designing  adaptive controllers with transient performances equivalent to steady state performances while  ensuring much better control signal is verified in this thesis.",2018,1

It is extremely desirable while designing unmanned aerial vehicles, to enable them to accomplish their tasks with little human intervention. To achieve full autonomy, an optimal and robust control algorithm that covers complete flight phases is needed. Being propriety in nature, very little information is available in the literature that encompasses all modalities related to UAV design and development.

"eaa03d3134b2b27eedbded461251167e0771ee19","System Identification and Robust Control of Multi-Input Multi-Output Active Magnetic Bearing Systems","This paper studies the system identification and robust control of a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) active magnetic bearing (AMB) system. The AMB system under study is open-loop unstable, and the presence of right-half plane zeros and the rotor flexible modes bring additional degrees of difficulty to the control design of such a system. First, a closed-loop system identification is performed using frequency-domain-response data of the system. Genetic-algorithm-based weighted least squares method is employed to obtain the best frequency-weighted model of the system. As the cross-coupling channels have negligible gains in the low-frequency region, it is assumed that the system can be diagonalized. This allows the analysis of the system as a family of low-order single-input single-output (SISO) subsystems. On the other hand, the effects caused by the coupling channels become more significant at higher frequencies. Therefore, a similar method is used to obtain a high-order MIMO model of the system by including the cross-coupling effects. Next, SISO H∞ controllers and lead-lag-type compensators are designed on the basis of the SISO models of the systems. To strive for a better performance, MIMO H2 and HH∞ optimal controllers are synthesized on the basis of the MIMO model of the system. Extensive experimental studies are conducted on the performance of the designed SISO and MIMO controllers in real time by taking into consideration both constant disturbances while the rotor is stationary and sinusoidal disturbances caused by the centrifugal forces and the rotor mass imbalance while the rotor is in rotation. Unlike the recently published works, it is shown that the accurate modeling of the system being controlled is the key to the successful design of high-performance stable controllers that not only guarantee the internal stability of the system-controller interconnection but also that no further modifications are required before the real-time implementation of the designed controllers.",2016,66

The conventional measures to detect icing are either expensive, energy consuming or heavy. The purpose of this paper is to develop a fault identification and isolation scheme using unknown input observers to detect and isolate actuator and structural faults in simultaneous occurrence.   Design/methodology/approach The fault detection scheme is based on a deviation in system parameters due to icing and lock-in-place (LIP), two faults from different categories with similar indications that require different reconfiguration actions. The obtained residual signals are selected to be triggered by desired faults, while insensitive to others.   Findings The proposed observer is sensitive to both actuator and structural faults, and distinguishes simultaneous occurrences by insensitivity to LIP in selected residue signals. Simulation results confirm the success of the proposed system in the presence of uncertainty and disturbance.   Research limitations/implications The fault detection and isolation scheme proposed here is based on the linear model of a winged aircraft, the Aerosonde. Moreover, the faults are applied to rudder and aileron in simulations, but the design procedure for other models is provided. The designed scheme could be further implemented on a non-linear aircraft model.   Practical implications Applying the proposed icing detection scheme increases detection system reliability, since fault isolation enables timely reconfiguration schemes.

For example, a recent study [1] uses an LQR controller to balance the inverted pendulum on a quadrotor drone. However, these studies consider the length of the pendulum to be known a priori. Indeed, in certain applications this assumption might not hold true. For example, consider a quadrotor hoverboard being used by people of different heights. In such cases, an approach is required to estimate the length of the pendulum. This paper analyzes the linearized dynamics of the combined system of quadrotor and inverted pendulum. It is found that unknown length of pendulum causes the system to fall in the category of unmatched uncertain systems where the control input cannot be used to cancel the uncertainty. This paper formulates the problem in such a manner that the system is still controllable in presence of this unmatched uncertainty. A concurrent learning adaptive controller, which avoids the use of persistently exciting signals, is then utilized to estimate the unmatched uncertainty and hence the length of the pendulum.

Therefore, tail-sitter UAVs can be employed in complex missions such as door-to-door payload delivery over extended regions. However, these vehicles’ dynamics are nonlinear, and linear approximations poorly capture their behavior during the transition between vertical and horizontal flight regimes. Furthermore, these UAVs’ aerodynamic coefficients are usually difficult to measure in all flight regimes. Therefore, designing controllers for tail-sitter UAVs is still an open problem. Model reference adaptive control (MRAC) for prescribed performance allows the user to impose a priori both bounds on the trajectory tracking error and the rate of convergence of the tracking error without modifying the reference model or employing estimators. In this paper, MRAC for prescribed performance is extended for the first time to pursue the output signal tracking problem despite matched and parametric uncertainties in the plant’s dynamics. Successively, this adaptive control technique is applied to design a controller for the longitudinal dynamics of a class of tail-sitter UAVs, namely quad-biplanes, and enforce user-defined performance specifications despite modeling uncertainties in the vehicle’s aerodynamic properties.

We also attenuate the unmatched uncertainty based on the PPG minimization that is applicable to a broad class of systems with nominal linear dynamics. In addition, leveraging the PPG bound of an LPV system that is computable using linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques, we derive transient and steady-state performance bounds in terms of the input and output signals of the actual closed-loop system as compared to the same signals of a virtual reference system that represents the possibly best achievable performance. Under mild assumptions, we prove that the transient performance bounds can be uniformly reduced by decreasing the estimation sampling time, which is subject only to hardware limitations. The theoretical development is validated by extensive simulations on the short-period dynamics of an F-16 aircraft.",2020,13

"cef0c9be2939be6f9c92b866899babdbd26d51b7","Synchronisation-Oriented Design Approach for Adaptive Control","This study presents a synchronisation-oriented perspective towards adaptive control which views model-referenced adaptation as synchronisation between actual and virtual dynamic systems. In the context of adaptation, model reference adaptive control methods make the state response of the actual plant follow a reference model. In the context of synchronisation, consensus methods involving diffusive coupling induce a collective behaviour across multiple agents. We draw from the understanding about the two time-scale nature of synchronisation motivated by the study of blended dynamics. The synchronisation-oriented approach consists in the design of a coupling input to achieve desired closed-loop error dynamics followed by the input allocation process to shape the collective behaviour. We suggest that synchronisation can be a reasonable design principle allowing a more holistic and systematic approach to the design of adaptive control systems for improved transient characteristics. Most notably, the proposed approach enables not only constructive derivation but also substantial generalisation of the previously developed closed-loop reference model adaptive control method. Practical significance of the proposed generalisation lies at the capability to improve the transient response characteristics and mitigate the unwanted peaking phenomenon at the same time.",2024,0

A control-allocation (CA) module is developed to deal with composite actuator servo constraints that have usually been neglected in existing AHV control works. This CA process is realized with the help of the recent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm without involving any online optimization. In the followed adaptive controller design, several auxiliary signals are constructed to compensate for the possible CA error, while adaptive super-twist differentiators are employed to fast estimate the lumped effect of uncertain aerodynamic coefficients and unknown external disturbances. As a result, the adaptive control algorithm only needs three parameter updating laws, whose dimension is much lower than traditional adaptive control strategies for AHVs.

It is known that to retain the micro air vehicle system performance during the entire flight regime is difficult due to model uncertainties, large parameter variation and wind disturbances compared to flight velocity. An adaptive controller can adapt to the uncertainties but the complexity involved in their implementation is high due to unavailability of required sensor information and computational resources on a micro air vehicle platform. Lack of flight test results in the open literature incorporating adaptive control so far can be partially attributed to this complexity. In this case, adaptive control architecture is implemented in such a way that only the uncertainties in the system dynamics are taken care of by the adaptive control and desired nominal plant performance is achieved by the basic controller. The proposed adaptive controller architecture is implemented in real flight test, and improvement of tracking performance over a proportional–integral–derivative controller is demonstrated which illustrates superior performance to conventional architectures.

The architecture is similar to Linear Quadratic Gaussian controllers. When using full order observers, or Kalman filters, the stability robustness properties can typically degrade, and the system can be sensitive to errors in the plant model. The method presented here, called observer-based loop transfer recovery, asymptotically achieves positive real system behavior at certain loop break points during recovery. This paper presents design insight into using this method for flight control design problems, including systems using acceleration feedbacks that are nonminimum phase. During the design process the observer is artificially squared-up. This adds fictitious inputs to make the number of controls equal the number of measurements, and makes the observer design model minimum phase. This step is central to achieving the positive real behavior during recovery. To place the zeros in a desired location during plant squaring, a pole-placement algorithm is used. A design example using the X-45A Joint Unmanned Combat Air System dynamics is utilized to highlight the design approach.",2013,9

"ada765e1ca67b2cc8f8c382d86ac36e171f9bb14","Nonlinear Adaptive Dynamic Inversion Applied to a Generic Hypersonic Vehicle","Flight control of hypersonic vehicles is challenging because of the wide range of operating conditions encountered and certain aspects unique to high speed flight. A particular safety concern in hypersonic flight is the risk of an inlet unstart, which not only produces a significant decrease in thrust but also results in a change to the aerodynamics and thus can lead to the loss of the vehicle. Previous work on control design for hypersonic vehicles often uses linearized or simplified nonlinear dynamical models of the vehicle, and very little work has been done on recovering from unstart events. Using a generic hypersonic vehicle as a control design and simulation model, this paper develops a nonlinear adaptive dynamic inversion control architecture with a control allocation scheme to track realistic flight path angle trajectories. A robustness analysis is performed on the initial control architecture design, which shows that the control architecture is able to handle time delays, perturbations in stability derivatives, and reduced control surface effectiveness. The control architecture then is evaluated for its ability to handle inlet unstart. Simulation results presented in the paper demonstrate that the approach achieves desired tracking performance while being robust to the particular uncertainties and inlet unstart conditions studied.",2013,34

The system accounts here for both matched and unmatched unknown uncertainties that can act as plant as well as input effectiveness failures or damages. For adaptation of the unknown parameters of these uncertainties, the frequency selective learning approach is used. Its idea is to compute a filtered expression of the system uncertainty using multiple filters based on online instantaneous information, which is used for augmentation of the update law. It is capable of adjusting a sudden change in system dynamics without depending on high adaptation gains and can satisfy exponential parameter error convergence under certain conditions in the presence of structured matched and unmatched uncertainties as well. Additionally, the controller of the MRAC system is designed using a new optimal control method.

The challenges associated with the transient performance of adaptive control systems is first addressed using two new approaches that improve the transient performance. Specifically, the first approach is predicated on a novel controller architecture, which involves added terms in the update law entitled artificial basis functions. These terms are constructed through a gradient optimization procedure to minimize the system error between an uncertain dynamical system and a given reference model during the learning phase of an adaptive controller. The second approach is an extension of the first one and minimizes the effect of the system uncertainties more directly in the transient phase. In addition, this approach uses a varying gain to enforce performance bounds on the system error and is further generalized to adaptive control laws with nonlinear reference models. Another challenge in adaptive control systems is to achieve system stability and a prescribed level performance in the presence of actuator dynamics. It is well-known that if the actuator dynamics do not have sufficiently high bandwidth, their presence cannot be practically neglected in the design since they limit the achievable stability of adaptive control laws. Another major contribution of this dissertation is to address this challenge. In particular, first a linear matrix inequalities-based hedging approach is proposed, where this approach modifies the ideal reference model dynamics to allow for correct adaptation that is not affected by the presence of actuator dynamics. The stability limits of this approach are computed using linear matrix inequalities revealing the fundamental stability interplay between the parameters of the actuator dynamics and the allowable system uncertainties. In addition, these computations are used to provide a depiction of the feasible region of the actuator parameters such that the robustness to variation in the parameters is addressed. Furthermore, the convergence properties of the modified reference model to the ideal reference model are analyzed. Generalizations and applications of the proposed approach are then provided.

"306b96b0347796f17f809e57c15695f0cf0ad6ce","Systematic adaptive control design using sequential loop closure","This thesis presents a new, systematic method of synthesizing an output feedback adaptive controller for a class of uncertain, non-square multi-input/multi-output systems. The control design process consists of first designing an inner-loop controller for a reduced order plant model to enforce command tracking of selected inner-loop variables, with an adaptive element used to accommodate parametric uncertainties in the plant. Once this inner-loop control design is complete, an outer-loop is then designed which prescribes the inner-loop commands to enforce command tracking of selected outer-loop variables. The main challenge that needs to be addressed when designing the inner-loop controller is the determination of a corresponding square and strictly positive real transfer function. The first contribution of this thesis is the design of a new procedure to synthesize two gain matrices that allow the realization of such a transfer function, thereby allowing a globally stable adaptive output feedback law to be generated. The unique features of this output feedback adaptive controller are a baseline controller that uses a Luenberger observer, a closed-loop reference model, manipulations of a bilinear matrix inequality, and the KalmanYakubovich lemma. Using these features, a simple design procedure is proposed for the adaptive controller, and the corresponding stability property is established. The outer-loop controller is designed around the plant with existing adaptive inner-loop controller such that global stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed. The design of the outer-loop uses components of a closed-loop reference model in a judicious manner which enables a modular approach, without any re-design of the inner-loop controller. In addition, this architecture facilitates the use of an additional state-limiter to enforce desired limits on the state variables. A numerical example based on a scramjet powered, generic hypersonic vehicle model is presented, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed control design. The six-degree-offreedom nonlinear vehicle model is linearized, giving the design model for which the controller is synthesized. The adaptive output feedback controller is then applied to an evaluation model, which is nonlinear, coupled, and includes actuator dynamics, and it is shown to result 3 in stable tracking in the presence of uncertainties that destabilize the baseline controller. Benefits of various aspects of the sequential and modular control design as well as its adaptive components are clearly illustrated in this numerical example. Thesis Supervisor: Anuradha M.

The proposed hierarchical control procedure augments the ubiquitous Linear-Quadratic-Regulator (LQR) with an online reconfiguration block that acts as a superior regulator to dynamically adjust the critical weighting-factors of LQR’s quadratic-performance-index (QPI). The Algebraic-Riccati-Equation (ARE) uses these updated weighting-factors to re-compute the optimal control problem, after every sampling interval, to deliver time-varying state-feedback gains. This article experimentally compares four state-of-the-art rule-based online adaptation mechanisms that dynamically restructure the constituent blocks of the ARE. The proposed hierarchical control procedures are synthesized by self-adjusting the (i) controller’s degree-of-stability, (ii) the control-weighting-factor of QPI, (iii) the state-weighting-factors of QPI as a function of “state-error-phases”, and (iv) the state-weighting-factors of QPI as a function of “state-error-magnitudes”.

The implications of each mechanism on the controller’s behaviour are analyzed in real-time by conducting credible hardware-in-the-loop experiments on the QNET Rotary-Pendulum setup.

This framework is then used to reveal, through stability analysis tools, the stability limit of the MRAC–human closed-loop system and the range of model parameters respecting this limit. An illustrative numerical example of an adaptive flight control application with a Neal–Smith pilot model is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of developed approaches.",2018,33

This implies that these controllers cannot tolerate large system uncertainties even when the unmodelled dynamics satisfy a set of conditions. In this paper, we present an adaptive control architecture such that the proposed adaptive controller is augmented with an adaptive robustifying term. Unlike standard adaptive controllers, the proposed architecture allows the closed-loop dynamical system to remain stable in the presence of large system uncertainties when the unmodelled system dynamics satisfy a set of conditions. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.",2018,29

First, a controller parametric model with unknown plant parameters is established, and actuator parameters are determined using a unified actuator fault model. Second, some existing proper modifications that allow MRAC to gain the ability of actuator fault compensation are given. Then final adaptive fault compensation controller is constructed by utilizing existing results and a new adaptation law that is based on a method first used for optimization purposes.

We propose to use an iterative modular approach: we first design a robust nonlinear state feedback that renders the closed‐loop input‐to‐state stable (ISS). Here, the input is considered to be the estimation error of the uncertain parameters, and the state is considered to be the closed‐loop output tracking error. Next, we propose an iterative adaptive algorithm, where we augment this robust ISS controller with an iterative data‐driven learning algorithm to estimate online the parametric uncertainties of the model. We implement this method with two different learning approaches. The first one is a data‐driven multiparametric extremum seeking method, which guarantees local convergence results, and the second is a Bayesian optimization‐based method called Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound, which guarantees global results in a compact search set. The combination of the ISS feedback and the data‐driven learning algorithms gives a learning‐based modular indirect adaptive controller. We show the efficiency of this approach on a two‐link robot manipulator numerical example.",2018,8

Motivated from this point, an adaptive set-theoretic emulator reference architecture (ASTERA) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the ASTERA has two major components — a state emulator and a set-theoretic adaptive controller. Based on a given reference model capturing a desired closed-loop system performance, the state emulator alters the trajectories of this model with the system error (the difference between the uncertain dynamical system state and the state emulator state) for the purpose of achieving smooth transients — transients that do not necessarily exhibit high-frequency oscillations (a property that does not necessarily exist in standard set-theoretic model reference adaptive control methods). In addition, the set-theoretic adaptive controller assures the weighted Euclidean norm of this system error to be less than a-priori, userdefined scalar worst-case bound, which ensures the state emulator trajectories stay close to the given reference model trajectories as desired (a property that does not exist in standard state emulator-based standard adaptive control methods), for the purpose of achieving performance guarantees.

The ubiquitous Linear-Quadratic-Regulator (LQR) is employed as the baseline state-feedback controller. Despite its optimality, the LQR lacks robustness against parametric uncertainties. Hence, the main contribution of this paper is to devise and retrofit the LQR with a stable online gain-adjustment mechanism that dynamically adjusts the state weighting-coefficients of LQR’s quadratic cost-function via state-error dependent nonlinear-scaling functions. An original self-mutating phase-based adaptive modulation scheme is systematically formulated in this paper to self-adjust the state weighting-coefficients. The scheme employs pre-calibrated secant-hyperbolic-functions whose waveforms are dynamically reconfigured online based on the variations in magnitude and polarity of state-error variables. This augmentation dynamically alters the solution of the Riccati-Equation which modifies the state-feedback gains online. The proposed adaptation flexibly manipulates the system’s control effort as the response converges to or diverges from the reference. The efficacy of proposed adaptive controller is validated by conducting hardware-in-the-loop experiments to vertically stabilize the QNET 2.0 Rotary Pendulum system. As compared to the standard LQR, the proposed adaptive controller renders rapid transits in system’s response with improved damping against oscillations, while maintaining its asymptotic-stability, under bounded exogenous disturbances.",2020,21

The challenges associated with the transient performance of adaptive control systems is first addressed using two new approaches that improve the transient performance. Specifically, the first approach is predicated on a novel controller architecture, which involves added terms in the update law entitled artificial basis functions. These terms are constructed through a gradient optimization procedure to minimize the system error between an uncertain dynamical system and a given reference model during the learning phase of an adaptive controller. The second approach is an extension of the first one and minimizes the effect of the system uncertainties more directly in the transient phase. In addition, this approach uses a varying gain to enforce performance bounds on the system error and is further generalized to adaptive control laws with nonlinear reference models. Another challenge in adaptive control systems is to achieve system stability and a prescribed level performance in the presence of actuator dynamics. It is well-known that if the actuator dynamics do not have sufficiently high bandwidth, their presence cannot be practically neglected in the design since they limit the achievable stability of adaptive control laws. Another major contribution of this dissertation is to address this challenge. In particular, first a linear matrix inequalities-based hedging approach is proposed, where this approach modifies the ideal reference model dynamics to allow for correct adaptation that is not affected by the presence of actuator dynamics. The stability limits of this approach are computed using linear matrix inequalities revealing the fundamental stability interplay between the parameters of the actuator dynamics and the allowable system uncertainties. In addition, these computations are used to provide a depiction of the feasible region of the actuator parameters such that the robustness to variation in the parameters is addressed. Furthermore, the convergence properties of the modified reference model to the ideal reference model are analyzed. Generalizations and applications of the proposed approach are then provided.

However, in cyber-physical systems such assmart grids, transportation networks, healthcare, and robotic systems, there still existseveral challenges that prevent the implementation of intelligent control strategies.These challenges include the existence of limited communication networks, dynamicand stochastic environments, multiple decision makers interacting with the system,and complex hybrid dynamics emerging from the feedback interconnection of physicalprocesses and computational devices.In this dissertation, we study the problem of designing robust control and optimizationalgorithms for cyber-physical systems using the framework of hybrid dynamicalsystems. We propose different theoretical frameworks for the design and analysis offeedback mechanisms that optimize the performance of dynamical systems without requiringan explicit characterization of their mathematical model, i.e., in a model-freeway. The closed-loop system that emerges of the interconnection of the plant with thefeedback mechanism describes, in general, a set-valued hybrid dynamical system.

"98252733630f4ffdbb1e6cdc5ccb8b22171a3fd2","Control of Uncertain Dynamical Systems with Spatial and Temporal Constraints","The overarching objective of this dissertation is the development of feedback control frameworks for uncertain dynamical systems that are subject to spatial and/or temporal constraints. These spatiotemporal constraints usually arise from the physical and/or performance characteristics associated with a considered dynamical system in safety-critical applications, where synthesis and analysis of feedback control laws are not trivial. Specifically, the proposed control architectures in this dissertation mainly contribute to the model reference adaptive control and finite-time control literature. In particular, unlike existing model reference adaptive control approaches that are not capable of enforcing user-defined performance guarantees without an ad-hoc tuning process, the proposed control architectures utilize an error-dependent learning rate that enables a control designer to assign a user-defined performance bound to the system trajectories. In addition, the convergence time of the existing finite-time controllers either depends on the initial conditions of the system or the upper bound on the system uncertainties; hence, this convergence time cannot be strictly assigned by the control designer. The proposed finite-time control algorithms in this dissertation utilize a time transformation technique to address this challenge, where the resulting convergence time is independent of the initial conditions and the knowledge of upper bound of the system uncertainties. Research in adaptive control theory has demonstrated the capabilities of these feedback algorithms in suppressing the effects of adverse conditions resulting from exogenous disturbances, imperfect system modeling, degraded modes of operation, and changes in system dynamics. Yet, not only standard adaptive controllers usually yield to conservative performance bound on the system error signal, but also they require the knowledge of the upper bound on the system uncertainties to specify such a bound. Therefore, a major challenge in standard adaptive control algorithms is their inability to address control problems with a-priori given spatial constraints. In this dissertation, this critical issue is addressed by introducing the set-theoretic model reference adaptive control architecture. This approach utilizes so-called generalized restricted potential functions by incorporating a system error-dependent learning rate in the adaptation process.

This problem is strictly related to the estimation of the reachable set (RS) from a fixed set of initial conditions and it is typically tackled using the Lyapunov's direct method. One well-known drawback of this approach is the excessive conservatism in the estimation of the RS. To overcome this limitation the authors propose a novel probabilistic framework where uncertain parameters and control signals are considered as random variables. In this framework the RS design is translated into a stochastic convex optimisation problem. This brings the benefit that (probabilistic) LMIs with reduced conservatism can be worked out. The so-called scenario optimisation approach is then used to solve the stochastic optimisation problem with a-priori specified level of reliability.

The innovation presented in this study is considering a new form for the Lyapunov function candidate to prove the stability of the closed-loop system. In general, a Lyapunov function candidate contains two sets of quadratic expressions. The first set contains the state tracking error variable, while the second one consists of the controller parameter estimation errors. We prove that by choosing the tracking error quadratic expressions in the form of the exponential function, new adaptive laws that contain the tracking error quadratic expressions are obtained. The difference between the standard MRAC adaptive laws and the proposed new adaptive laws is the state tracking error exponential quadratic expression appears in the adaptive laws. It is shown that the adaptive laws obtained by the exponential quadratic Lyapunov function are similar to those obtained by the quadratic Lyapunov function except that the adaptive gains are variable with time. The advantage of using these new adaptive laws is improving the tracking performance of the closed-loop system, which has been proven analytically and verified by numerical simulations.

In the context of adaptation, model reference adaptive control methods make the state response of the actual plant follow a reference model. In the context of synchronisation, consensus methods involving diffusive coupling induce a collective behaviour across multiple agents. We draw from the understanding about the two time-scale nature of synchronisation motivated by the study of blended dynamics. The synchronisation-oriented approach consists in the design of a coupling input to achieve desired closed-loop error dynamics followed by the input allocation process to shape the collective behaviour. We suggest that synchronisation can be a reasonable design principle allowing a more holistic and systematic approach to the design of adaptive control systems for improved transient characteristics. Most notably, the proposed approach enables not only constructive derivation but also substantial generalisation of the previously developed closed-loop reference model adaptive control method.

The objective is to extend the L1 adaptive control framework to cover a wide class of underactuated systems with uniform performance and robustness guarantees. This dissertation starts by investigating some structural properties of multivariable systems that are used in the development of L1 adaptive output feedback controllers. In particular, a state-decomposition is introduced for adaptive laws that only depends on the output signals. The existence of the decomposition is ensured by defining a virtual system for underactuated plants. Based on the mathematical findings, we propose a set of output feedback solutions for uncertain underactuated systems. In adaptive control applications, a baseline control augmentation is often preferred, where the baseline controller defines the nominal system response. Adaptive controllers are incorporated into the control loop to improve the system response by recovering the nominal performance in the presence of uncertainties. This thesis provides a solution for L1 output feedback control augmentation. Stability and transient performance bounds are proven using Lyapunov analysis. To demonstrate the benefits of the L1 adaptive controllers we consider a missile system and an inverted pendulum, which are both underactuated systems. Finally, we propose a filter design framework in the frequency domain. A new sufficient condition is presented to ensure stability of the closed loop and the reference systems, which is subsequently used in the optimal filter design.

The main idea is to introduce a nonlinear compensator to reshape the closed‐loop system transient, and to suggest a new adaptive law with guaranteed convergence. The compensator captures the unknown system dynamics and modifies the given nominal reference model and the control action. This modified controlled system can approach the response of the ideal reference model. The transient is easily tuned by a new design parameter of this compensator. The nominal adaptive law is augmented by new leakage terms containing the parameter estimation errors. This allows for fast, smooth and exponential convergence of both the tracking error and parameter estimation, which again improves overall reference model following. We also show that the required excitation condition for the estimation convergence is equivalent to the classical persistent excitation (PE) condition. In this respect, this paper provides an intuitive and numerically feasible approach to online validate the PE condition. The salient feature of the suggested methodology is that the rapid suppression of uncertainties in the controlled system can be achieved without using a large, high‐gain induced, learning rate in the adaptive laws.

With persistent excitation of the regressor vector in model reference adaptive control the state error and the adaptation error are globally exponentially stable or, equivalently, exponentially stable in the large. When the excitation condition, however, is imposed on the reference input or the reference model state, it is often incorrectly concluded that the persistent excitation in those signals also implies exponential stability in the large. The definition of persistent excitation is revisited so as to address some possible confusion in the adaptive control literature. It is then shown that persistent excitation of the reference model only implies local persistent excitation (weak persistent excitation). Weak persistent excitation of the regressor is still sufficient for uniform asymptotic stability in the large, but not exponential stability in the large. We show that there exists an infinite region in the state-space of adaptive systems where the state rate is bounded.

In this paper, the input and structural coupled uncertainties are modeled and transformed into a system state related term, an internal state related term and a system input related term. With the aid of the actual exponential input-state stability and the dynamic auxiliary signal, the internal state related uncertainties can be suppressed. By utilizing the properties of the robot dynamics and several special nonlinear functions, the system state related uncertainties can be handled. Moreover, to overcome the system input related uncertainties, an indirect control law and the adaptive boundary estimation law have been designed. To simplify the control structure, the neural networks have been introduced as online approximators.

Striking examples include pulse design for exciting spin ensembles in quantum physics, neurostimulation for relieving neurological disorder symptoms, and path planning for steering robot swarms. However, the control targets in such applications are generally large-scale complex and severely underactuated ensemble systems, research into which stretches the capability of techniques in classical control and dynamical systems theory to the very limit. This paper then devotes to advancing our knowledge about controllability of linear ensemble systems by integrating tools in modern algebra into the technique of separating points developed in our recent work. In particular, we give an algebraic interpretation of the dynamics of linear systems in terms of actions of polynomials on vector spaces, and this leads to the development of the functional canonical form of matrix-valued functions, which can also be viewed as the generalization of the rational canonical form of matrices in linear algebra. Then, leveraging the technique of separating points, we achieve a necessary and sufficient characterization of uniform ensemble controllability for time-invariant linear ensemble systems as the ensemble controllability canonical form, in which the system and control matrices are in the functional canonical and block diagonal form, respectively. This work successfully launches a new research scheme by adopting and tailoring finite-dimensional methods to tackle control problems involving infinite-dimensional ensemble systems, and lays a solid foundation for a more inclusive ensemble control theory targeting a much broader spectrum of control and learning problems in both scientific research and practice.",2022,0

In this work, we consider Markov jump linear systems (MJSs), a special class of switched systems where the active mode switches according to a Markov chain, and several issues associated with its mode complexity. Specifically, inspired by clustering techniques from unsupervised learning, we are able to construct a reduced MJS with fewer modes that approximates the original MJS well under various metrics.

In many of such applications, control can only be implemented at the population level, i.e., through broadcasting an input signal to all the systems in the population, and this new control paradigm challenges the classical systems theory. In recent years, considerable efforts have been made to investigate controllability properties of ensemble systems, and most works emphasized on linear and some forms of bilinear and nonlinear ensemble systems. In this paper, we study controllability of a broad class of bilinear ensemble systems defined on semisimple Lie groups, for which we define the notion of ensemble controllability through a Riemannian structure of the state space Lie group. Leveraging the Cartan decomposition of semisimple Lie algebras in representation theory, we develop a \emph{covering method} that decomposes the state space Lie group into a collection of Lie subgroups generating the Lie group, which enables the determination of ensemble controllability by controllability of the subsystems evolving on these Lie subgroups. Using the covering method, we show the equivalence between ensemble and classical controllability, i.e., controllability of each individual system in the ensemble implies ensemble controllability, for bilinear ensemble systems evolving on semisimple Lie groups. This equivalence makes the examination of controllability for infinite-dimensional ensemble systems as tractable as for a finite-dimensional single system.",2020,8

A distributed least squares (LS) algorithm based on diffusion strategy is proposed such that the sensors can cooperatively estimate the unknown time-invariant parameter vector from continuous-time noisy signals. By using the martingal estimation theory and Ito formula, we provide upper bounds for the estimation error of the proposed distributed LS algorithm, and further obtain the convergence results under a cooperative excitation condition.

Classical adaptive parameter estimation algorithms demand to satisfy persistence of excitation (PE) or its distributed variant cooperative persistent of excitation (C‐PE) for parameter convergence. PE, C‐PE, are restrictive in nature since it requires excitation (richness of information content) over the entire time span of the signal/data, making it unrealistic in most real‐world applications, especially in robotics and cyber‐physical systems. Unlike past literature, the proposed work ensures parameter convergence under a slackened condition, coined as cooperative initial excitation (C‐IE), which demands information richness only in the initial time‐window (transient period) suitable for practical scenarios. A distributed differential parameter estimator algorithm is designed, which with the help of stable closed‐loop filter dynamics and strategic switching guarantees global exponential stability (GES) of the parameter estimation error dynamics in the sense of Lyapunov. The formulation is further augmented by providing an online optimization perspective. A novel cost function is constructed in such a way that the proposed distributed parameter estimator acts as a distributed continuous‐time gradient‐descent algorithm based on the cost function and the true uncertain parameter vector is the global minima of the cost function. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in contrast to the PE/C‐PE based methods.",2023,1

The proposed method relies on a network of gradient-descent-based estimators, each of which exploits only a portion of the input-output data. A key feature of the method is that the input-output signals are hybrid, so they may evolve in continuous time (i.e., they may flow), or they may change at isolated time instances (i.e., they may jump). The estimators are interconnected over a weakly-connected directed graph, so the alternation of flows and jumps combined with the distributed character of the algorithm introduce a rich behavior that is impossible to obtain using continuous- or discrete-time estimators. A condition of persistence of excitation in hybrid form ensures exponential convergence of the estimation errors. The proposed approach generalizes the existing centralized gradient-descent algorithms and yields relaxed sufficient conditions for (uniform-exponential) parameter estimation. In addition, we address the observation/identification problem for a class of hybrid systems with unknown parameters using a distributed network of adaptive observers/identifiers.",2022,0

The concept of CRM is recently proposed in literature for single-agent MRAC problems, where the reference model (leader) gets feedback from the plant (agent/follower) to facilitate improved transient performance. This letter coins the concept of CRM based distributed MRAC, where it is assumed that the leader/reference model is connected only to a subset of followers and incorporates feedback from them in a multi-agent setting. Distributed parameter estimator and controller are designed, which incorporate inter-agent cooperation via communication over a bi-directional graph. The leader state and the time-varying leader input (also known as reference input in MRAC literature) are only accessible to its neighbours. A novel distributed dynamic surface control (DSC)-like strategy is invoked for each follower to cooperatively estimate the unknown reference input required for control design. Simulation results dictate that the proposed closed-loop leader based formulation leads to better transient performance as compared to the status quo and also enables the use of high gain tuners for adaptive update law. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first work which introduces a distributed protocol of CRM-MRAC for multi-agent systems (CRM-DMRAC) with rigorous Lyapunov analysis.",2021,9

Classical adaptive controllers require an analytical condition, called persistence of excitation (PE), to ensure parameter convergence, which results in better transient performance and robustness to disturbance. The PE condition is extended to Cooperative-PE (C-PE) condition for distributed adaptive controllers with cooperative estimation strategies. The PE and C-PE conditions are restrictive in nature since these conditions are not satisfied in most practical applications. Recent literature in adaptive control has relaxed the PE condition to Initial Excitation (IE), which is shown to be sufficient for parameter convergence. The IE condition is argued to be significantly milder than PE and can be satisfied in many practical setting. The proposed result further extends the IE condition to Cooperative-IE (C-IE) condition in distributed adaptive control architecture in the context of synchronizing multiple EL systems. It is established that the C-IE condition is milder than PE, IE, and C-PE conditions. Two-tier filter based estimation algorithm with strategic switching ensures parameter convergence under the C-IE condition and thereby provides exponential convergence of tracking and parameter estimation error to zero. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm as compared to conventional distributed adaptive controllers in terms of superior tracking and estimation performance.",2020,4

Conventional online parameter estimation algorithms, which are used for system identification, require a restrictive condition of persistence of excitation (PE) for the estimates to converge to the true parameters. Some recent works have shown that collaborative system identification using multiple agents can relax the PE condition to a milder condition of collective persistence of excitation (C-PE) for parameter convergence. The C-PE condition implies that the PE condition is cooperatively satisfied by all the agents through sharing information between neighbors using a connected graph architecture, where each individual agent does not require to satisfy the PE condition separately. The proposed work designs a novel collaborative parameter estimator dynamics, which with the help of integral-like component ensures parameter convergence under a further slackened condition; coined as collective Initial Excitation (C-IE). The C-IE condition is an extension of the concept of initial excitation (IE), which is recently proposed in the context of parameter estimation in adaptive control. It has been already established that IE condition is significantly less restrictive than PE. The current work generalizes the concept of IE in a multi-agent settings, where information sharing through connected graph guarantees consensus parameter convergence under the C-IE condition.

To enable the online passive identifier, we develop a distributed cooperative Kalman filter run by each sensing agent that provides state estimates of the field.

"c4169397351bd8af8b3dcf54bed49473a2d3b212","Spatial Formation Control","In this thesis, we study robust spatial formation control from several aspects. First, we study robust adaptive attitude synchronization for a network of rigid body agents using various attitude error functions defined on SO(3). Our results are particularly useful for networks with large initial attitude difference. We devise an adaptive geometric approach to cope with situations where the inertia matrices are not available for measurement. We use the Frobenius norm as a measure for the difference between the actual values of inertia matrices and their estimated values, to construct the individual adaptive laws of the agents. Compared to the previous methods for synchronization on SO(3) such as those which are based on quaternions, our proposed approach does not contain any attitude representation ambiguity. As the final part of our studies from the attitude synchronization aspect, we analyze robustness to external disturbances and unmodeled dynamics, and propose a method to attenuate such effects. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In the next part of the thesis, we study the distributed localization of the extremum point of unknown quadratic functions representing various physical or artificial signal potential fields. It is assumed that the value of such functions can be measured at each instant. Using high pass filtering of the measured signals, a linear parametric model is obtained for system identification. For design purposes, we add a consensus term to modify the identification subsystem. Next, we analyze the exponential convergence of the proposed estimation scheme using algebraic graph theory. In addition, we derive a distributed identifiability condition and use it for the construction of distributed extremum seeking control laws. In particular, we show that for a network of connected agents, if each agent contains a portion of the dithering signals, it is still possible to drive the system states to the extremum point provided that the distributed identifiability condition is satisfied. iii In the final part of this research, several robust control problems for general linear time invariant multi-agent systems are studied. We consider the robust consensus problem in the presence of unknown Lipschitz nonlinearities and polytopic uncertainties in the model of each agent. Next, this problem is solved in the presence of external disturbances. A set of control laws is proposed for the network to attain the consensus task and under the zero initial condition, achieves the desired H-infinity performance.

The control design process consists of first designing an inner-loop controller for a reduced order plant model to enforce command tracking of selected inner-loop variables, with an adaptive element used to accommodate parametric uncertainties in the plant. Once this inner-loop control design is complete, an outer-loop is then designed, which prescribes the inner-loop commands to enforce command tracking of selected outer-loop variables. The main challenge that needs to be addressed when designing the inner-loop controller is the determination of a corresponding square and strictly positive real transfer function.

Local linearization-based design has been used for adaptive control of non-canonical nonlinear aircraft systems, due to certain desired capacity to handle complexity of non-canonical aircraft system dynamics for which most existing nonlinear control methods are not applicable. As a benchmark study, this paper addresses a general longitudinal dynamic motion of rigid aircraft systems in a non-canonical form with unparametrizable uncertainties. A semi-global linearization-based control method is developed for such aircraft systems by constructing a new reparametrization procedure based on T-S fuzzy system approximation using local linearized models and a relative degree formulation, and then developing an adaptive controller to ensure closed-loop stability and asymptotic output tracking for T-S fuzzy approximation aircraft systems. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.",2016,2

"bac6c914288d72046aa5077ebed3f5f48784abd9","Data-driven methods for statistical verification of uncertain nonlinear systems","Due to the increasing complexity of autonomous, adaptive, and nonlinear systems, engineers commonly rely upon statistical techniques to verify that the closed-loop system satisfies specified performance requirements at all possible operating conditions. However, these techniques require a large number of simulations or experiments to exhaustively search the set of possible parametric uncertainties for conditions that lead to failure. This work focuses on resource-constrained applications, such as preliminary control system design or experimental testing, which cannot rely upon exhaustive search to analyze the robustness of the closed-loop system to those requirements. This thesis develops novel statistical verification frameworks that combine datadriven statistical learning techniques and control system verification. First, two frameworks are introduced for verification of deterministic systems with binary and non-binary evaluations of each trajectory’s robustness. These frameworks implement machine learning models to learn and predict the satisfaction of the requirements over the entire set of possible parameters from a small set of simulations or experiments. In order to maximize prediction accuracy, closed-loop verification techniques are developed to iteratively select parameter settings for subsequent tests according to their expected improvement of the predictions. Second, extensions of the deterministic verification frameworks redevelop these procedures for stochastic systems and these new stochastic frameworks achieve similar improvements. Lastly, the thesis details a method for transferring information between simulators or from simulators to experiments. Moreover, this method is introduced as part of a new failure-adverse closedloop verification framework, which is shown to successfully minimize the number of failures during experimental verification without undue conservativeness. Ultimately, these data-driven verification frameworks provide principled approaches for efficient verification of nonlinear systems at all stages in the control system development cycle.

A nonlinear dynamic model of a HALE vehicle is considered with a primary flight controller based on nonlinear dynamic inversion. Individual disturbance estimating filters (DEF) are designed to estimate and mitigate the effect of disturbances using sensor/actuator pairs of the aircraft. The individual DEFs are single-input single-output (SISO) disturbance observers for gust-load alleviation (DOGLAs) that are then combined together into a decoupled multi-input multi-output (D-MIMO) DOGLA. The D-MIMO DOGLA contains SISO DOGLAs dedicated to canceling out the effect of wind gusts on the body roll, pitch, and yaw rates of the aircraft, as well as on the deflection of the flexible wings.

"306b96b0347796f17f809e57c15695f0cf0ad6ce","Systematic adaptive control design using sequential loop closure","This thesis presents a new, systematic method of synthesizing an output feedback adaptive controller for a class of uncertain, non-square multi-input/multi-output systems. The control design process consists of first designing an inner-loop controller for a reduced order plant model to enforce command tracking of selected inner-loop variables, with an adaptive element used to accommodate parametric uncertainties in the plant. Once this inner-loop control design is complete, an outer-loop is then designed which prescribes the inner-loop commands to enforce command tracking of selected outer-loop variables. The main challenge that needs to be addressed when designing the inner-loop controller is the determination of a corresponding square and strictly positive real transfer function. The first contribution of this thesis is the design of a new procedure to synthesize two gain matrices that allow the realization of such a transfer function, thereby allowing a globally stable adaptive output feedback law to be generated. The unique features of this output feedback adaptive controller are a baseline controller that uses a Luenberger observer, a closed-loop reference model, manipulations of a bilinear matrix inequality, and the KalmanYakubovich lemma. Using these features, a simple design procedure is proposed for the adaptive controller, and the corresponding stability property is established. The outer-loop controller is designed around the plant with existing adaptive inner-loop controller such that global stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed. The design of the outer-loop uses components of a closed-loop reference model in a judicious manner which enables a modular approach, without any re-design of the inner-loop controller. In addition, this architecture facilitates the use of an additional state-limiter to enforce desired limits on the state variables. A numerical example based on a scramjet powered, generic hypersonic vehicle model is presented, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed control design. The six-degree-offreedom nonlinear vehicle model is linearized, giving the design model for which the controller is synthesized. The adaptive output feedback controller is then applied to an evaluation model, which is nonlinear, coupled, and includes actuator dynamics, and it is shown to result 3 in stable tracking in the presence of uncertainties that destabilize the baseline controller. Benefits of various aspects of the sequential and modular control design as well as its adaptive components are clearly illustrated in this numerical example. Thesis Supervisor: Anuradha M.

First, theoretical relationship between the system states (strain, strain rate, body velocity, attitude etc.) and the sensor measurements are derived. Using the derived relationship, a nonlinear least squares fit is developed to obtain wing shape snapshots as well as rigid body attitude. The second method employs a Kalman filter to obtain both shape and rate information. The first method is more accurate since it employs nonlinear strain-displacement relationship at the cost of higher computational cost. However, in the presence of noise in the sensor measurement, the Kalman filter is faster and performs better in terms of accuracy.",2016,6

First, introducing the variable geometry inlet to take proper mass flow into the engine without any flow spillage ensures enough thrust for acceleration and maneuvering flight. The interval type-2 FLS integrated with an adaptive control algorithm is derived to approximate the complicated nonlinear items in the control strategy online, which assures that the tracking error are semi-globally uniformly bounded. After that, the fixed-time disturbance observer that is constructed to provide the estimations of uncertainty including external disturbance leads to a more practical and robust flight control system for AHV-VGI. The uniform stability of the whole system is proved under the framework of Lyapunov theory. Finally, simulation results and analysis are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed composite control scheme.",2022,1

Three main technical areas were addressed: seamless transition of implicit large eddy simulation to direct numerical simulation, the development of secondary motion in corner flows, and large-scale unsteadiness of separated shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions. High-order numerical simulations of a Mach 2.3 turbulent equilibrium boundary-layer flow were performed with increasing resolution until all fluid scales in the domain were fully resolved. It was found that the high-fidelity implicit large-eddy simulations converged seamlessly to direct numerical simulation and the turbulent statistics were found to be essentially independent of the domain width for values greater than twice the maximum boundary layer thickness. Numerical simulations of turbulent equilibrium boundary layer flow in the presence of a second wall yielded the development of secondary motion, which significantly increased the three-dimensionality of the subsequent shock boundary-layer interaction in the system. Inclusion of both sidewalls was required to accurately predict the separation location. Introduction of the quadratic relationship into Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes models did generate secondary motion for compressible corner flows. However, the improved low-fidelity results did not fully match the high-fidelity implicit large eddy simulations.

The control design process consists of first designing an inner-loop controller for a reduced order plant model to enforce command tracking of selected inner-loop variables, with an adaptive element used to accommodate parametric uncertainties in the plant. Once this inner-loop control design is complete, an outer-loop is then designed which prescribes the inner-loop commands to enforce command tracking of selected outer-loop variables. The main challenge that needs to be addressed when designing the inner-loop controller is the determination of a corresponding square and strictly positive real transfer function. The first contribution of this thesis is the design of a new procedure to synthesize two gain matrices that allow the realization of such a transfer function, thereby allowing a globally stable adaptive output feedback law to be generated. The unique features of this output feedback adaptive controller are a baseline controller that uses a Luenberger observer, a closed-loop reference model, manipulations of a bilinear matrix inequality, and the KalmanYakubovich lemma. Using these features, a simple design procedure is proposed for the adaptive controller, and the corresponding stability property is established. The outer-loop controller is designed around the plant with existing adaptive inner-loop controller such that global stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed. The design of the outer-loop uses components of a closed-loop reference model in a judicious manner which enables a modular approach, without any re-design of the inner-loop controller. In addition, this architecture facilitates the use of an additional state-limiter to enforce desired limits on the state variables. A numerical example based on a scramjet powered, generic hypersonic vehicle model is presented, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed control design. The six-degree-offreedom nonlinear vehicle model is linearized, giving the design model for which the controller is synthesized. The adaptive output feedback controller is then applied to an evaluation model, which is nonlinear, coupled, and includes actuator dynamics, and it is shown to result 3 in stable tracking in the presence of uncertainties that destabilize the baseline controller. Benefits of various aspects of the sequential and modular control design as well as its adaptive components are clearly illustrated in this numerical example. Thesis Supervisor: Anuradha M.

Recent technological advancements have made scramjet-powered flight achievable, as evidenced by the successes of the X-43A and X-51A flight test programs over the last decade. Air-breathing hypersonic vehicles present unique modeling and control challenges in large part due to the fact that scramjet propulsion systems are highly integrated into the airframe, resulting in strongly coupled and often unstable dynamics. Additionally, the extreme flight conditions and inability to test fully integrated vehicle systems larger than X-51 before flight leads to inherent uncertainty in hypersonic flight. This thesis presents a means to design vehicle geometries, simulate vehicle dynamics, and develop and analyze control systems for hypersonic vehicles. First, a software tool for generating three-dimensional watertight vehicle surface meshes from simple design parameters is developed. These surface meshes are compatible with existing vehicle analysis tools, with which databases of aerodynamic and propulsive forces and moments can be constructed. A six-degree-of-freedom nonlinear dynamics simulation model which incorporates this data is presented. Inner-loop longitudinal and lateral control systems are designed and analyzed utilizing the simulation model. The first is an output feedback proportional-integral linear controller designed using linear quadratic regulator techniques. The second is a model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) which augments this baseline linear controller with an adaptive element.

The overall setup is driven by an inverter, powered by an SOOV Li-ion battery bank. The main focus of this paper is comparison of the battery bank temperature and overall speed regulation performance when speed regulation is done via FOPI or integer order Proportional Integral (PI) control. Two major classes of tests are considered, first the performance of a Ziegler Nichols (ZN)-PI controller is compared against an FOPI controller tuned via existing rules in the literature. Then, the FOPI controller is made to use the same gains as the ZN-PI controller, but only the order of the integral is varied to non-integer values lesser than unity. Comparison based on simulation results show that simply using the ZN-PI gains but changing the order of the integral to values lower than unity, has definite effects on battery temperature, and SOC, and without sacrificing speed regulation performance compared to a tuned FOPI controller or a using a tuned PI controller.

Breaking the larger pack into smaller modules and using power electronics to achieve dynamic reconfiguration can be a solution. Reconfigurable batteries come with their own set of problems, including many sensors and complex monitoring systems, high-bandwidth communication interfaces, and additional costs. Online parameter estimation methods can simplify or omit many of these problems and reduce the cost and footprint of the system.

This paper proposes a simple decoupling technique to derive individual modules’ voltage and current profiles from the output measurements without direct measurement at the modules. The determined profiles can achieve a high sampling rate with minimum communication between the battery management system (BMS) and the modules. With accurate profiles, an estimation technique can easily determine the parameters of the modules.

For this reason we extend the proposed scheme to a distributed adaptive control scheme which can react to and compensate for possible changes in system parameters. In this case, system parameters are considered unknown and the controller gains are estimated on-line by an adaptive law. The applicability of the proposed schemes is demonstrated by an example.",2019,7

In this study, a new probabilistic scenario‐based method of optimal scheduling and operation of PMGs is developed. In this regard, different scenarios are generated using Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS). Furthermore, k‐means, k‐medoids, and differential evolution algorithms (DEA) are deployed to cluster the scenarios in the proposed method. A realistic commercial PMG in Iran is selected to apply the introduced method. The validity of the developed probabilistic optimization method for PMG operation is examined by comparing the results under various scenario reduction algorithms and MCS ones. The comparison of the obtained results and those of other existing deterministic methods highlights the advantages of the presented method. Furthermore, the sensitivity analyses are carried out to investigate the robustness of the developed method against the increase in the system uncertainty level. According to the test results, it is concluded that the k‐medoids algorithm has the best performance in comparison with the k‐means and the DEA‐based clustering under various conditions.",2020,37

In general, an optimal control method is regarded as an optimization process for solving the optimal control laws. However, for uncertain nonlinear systems with complex optimization objectives, the solving of optimal reference trajectories is difficult and significant that might be ignored to obtain robust performance. For this problem, a double-closed-loop robust optimal control (DCL-ROC) is proposed to maintain the optimal control reliability of uncertain nonlinear systems. First, a double-closed-loop scheme is established to divide the optimal control process into a closed-loop optimization process that solves optimal reference trajectories and a closed-loop control process that solves optimal control laws. Then, the ability of the optimal control method can be improved to solve complex uncertain optimization problems. Second, a closed-loop robust optimization (CL-RO) algorithm is developed to express uncertain optimization objectives as data-driven forms and adjust optimal reference trajectories in a close loop. Then, the optimality of reference trajectories can be improved under uncertainties. Third, the optimal reference trajectories are tracked by an adaptive controller to derive the optimal control laws without certain system dynamics. Then, the adaptivity and reliability of optimal control laws can be improved.

This paper studies novel strategies to enhance the transient response of model reference adaptive control (MRAC) for nonlinear aircraft systems with unmatched dynamics. We first develop a new compensator containing the undesired transient residual error to modify the external command. This can tune the command signal to be tracked to reshape the closed-loop system dynamics, whilst the original tracking objective is retained. Moreover, to diminish the potential high-frequency oscillations induced by the high-gain learning in the adaptive law, we resort to an error feedback term in the reference model to accelerate the convergence of the tracking error. In this new MRAC framework, a higher learning gain could be used to improve the tracking error convergence without triggering oscillations.

Feature Selection (FS) is widely used as a part of a biomedical ML pipeline to significantly reduce the number of variables while preserving as much information as possible. However, the choice of FS methods affects the entire pipeline including the final prediction explanations, whereas very few works investigate the relationship between FS and model explanations. Through a systematic workflow performed on 145 datasets and an illustration on medical data, the present work demonstrated the promising complementarity of two metrics based on explanations (using ranking and influence changes) in addition to accuracy and retention rate to select the most appropriate FS/ML models. Measuring how much explanations differ with/without FS are particularly promising for FS methods recommendation. While reliefF generally performs the best on average, the optimal choice may vary for each dataset. Positioning FS methods in a tridimensional space, integrating explanations-based metrics, accuracy and retention rate, would allow the user to choose the priorities to be given on each of the dimensions.

This paper thus presents an H∞ control-based robust CAS design for QTW-UAV via multiple-model approach with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to suppress the oscillatory motions. Although the adoption of the multiple-model approach to obtain robust CAS gains is the same as in our previous design, our new method has two unique features in contrast to the previously used method, that is, the design requirement for CAS gains is given in the frequency domain to shape the frequency responses from attitude command to attitude error and PSO is used to reduce the numerical complexity coming from a brute-force method, i.e., the gridding method. The overall control performance of the designed CAS gains is examined by human-in-the-loop nonlinear flight simulations.

The experiment evaluated the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) method to research the optimal gain of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) to hover accurately the bicopter model by minimizing error. The 3 degree of freedom (DOF) helicopter facility is a suitable bicopter experimental simulator to test its complex multiple input multiple output (MIMO) flight control model to respond to the challenge of multipurpose drone control strategies. The art of LQR setting is how to search for appropriate cost matrices scaling to optimize results. This study aims to accurately optimize take-off position control of the bicopter model by investigating LQR cost matrices variation in actual experiments. From the experimental results of weighted matrix variation on the bicopter simulator, the proposed LQR method has been successfully applied to achieve asymptotic stability of roll angle, although it yielded a significant overshoot. Moreover, the overshoot errors had good linearity to weighting variation. Despite that, the implementation of cost matrices is limited in the real bicopter experiment, and there are appropriate values for achieving an optimal accuracy. Moreover, the unstable step response of the controlled angle occurred because of excessive weighting.",2022,1

This is particularly relevant for reusable launchers, which are aimed at maximising their operational availability and payload capacity. Yet, despite various advances in aeronautics and wind energy load relief, classical feedback-only techniques remain the state-of-practice for launchers. In this article, an improved load relief functionality is proposed by augmenting a conventional control design with a disturbance observer for on-board wind anticipation. Without requiring any change in the feedback loop, this approach also paves the way for the use of forwardlooking wind estimation in the launcher domain. The disturbance observer is designed and analysed using robust control techniques for a lightweight, non-winged reusable launch vehicle, which relies on the use of planar fins for unpropelled descent attitude control. While the use of fins for launch is not a common practice, the article also exemplifies how their use can further improve launcher performance.",2019,4

First, gradient descent algorithm is incorporated in the context of the reinforcement learning control scheme to obtain the adaptive laws. Subsequently, considering the uncertainties in the nonlinear system, radial basis function (RBF) neural networks (NNs) are exploited to approximate the unknown internal dynamics. In contrast to the previous studies, aiming at accelerating the convergence in reinforcement learning control, a barrier Lyapunov function is constructed to constrain the states to ensure that the tracking error rapidly converges to a neighborhood of zero. Under the proposed control strategy, the states of the closed-loop system are proven to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded through rigorous Lyapunov analyses, and the state constraints are satisfied. Furthermore, the simulations and experiments conducted on a Quanser laboratory platform reveal that the proposed control functions are suitable and effective. Note to Practitioners—This paper is motivated by designing a reinforcement learning control strategy to enhance online learning capability and control performance of the controller for a nonlinear 2-DOF helicopter system. The control framework is divided into the design of the critic and actor NNs, responsible primarily for evaluating the control performance and approximating uncertainties in the system separately. Unlike the adaptive NN control, the actor NN weights are updated by combining information of states and inputs from the critic NN. In addition, aiming at accelerating the convergence, a barrier Lyapunov function is constructed to constrain the states to ensure that the tracking error rapidly converges to a neighborhood of zero.

The problem is divided into two subproblems: a robust proportional plus derivative state feedback stabilization (RPPDSFS) problem and a robust feed‐forward compensation (RFFC) problem. In the presence of uncertainties, by using the controller consisting of RPPDSFS part and RFFC part, all the signals of the closed‐loop system are bounded. The latter is equivalent to seeking three coefficient matrices such that a series of linear matrix equations are satisfied, and simultaneously the effect caused by uncertainties is minimized. Based on the right coprime factorization, the RFFC problem is further converted into a minimization problem with a quadratic performance index and some linear constraints. Thereafter, a linear matrix equation that determines the optimal solution is achieved. The restrictive condition that the coefficient matrix of the augmented reference system is non‐defective is relaxed, which reduces the conservativeness. A numerical example and the application of a three‐axis dynamic flight motion simulator manifest the effectiveness and the practicability of the proposed algorithm.",2023,0

A first robotic mission is set to scout the habitability of these underground architectures in the near future. The communication inside these underground tunnels is heavily constrained; hence, the scouting system should rely on a high degree of autonomy. At the same time, the exploration system may encounter different types of terrain, requiring an adaptable mobility subsystem able to travel fast on basaltic terrain while avoiding considerable obstacles. This paper presents a cave explorer’s mission study and preliminary sizing targeting the lunar lava tubes. The study proposes using a hybrid mobility system with wheels and thrusters to navigate smoothly inside the lava tubes. The peculiar mobility system of the cave explorer requires an accurate study of the adaptability of its control capabilities with the change of mass for a given set of sensors and actuators.

In double‐integrator multiagent systems, flocking algorithms that neglect agents' inertial effect can cause unstable group behavior. Despite the fact that an inertias‐independent protocol exists, the design of its control law is decided by dynamics and inertia. However, inertia in reality is difficult to measure accurately, therefore, the control gain in the consensus protocol was solved by developing adaptive dynamic programming to enable the double‐integrator systems to ensure the consensus of the agents in the presence of entirely unknown dynamics. Firstly, we demonstrate in a typical example how flocking algorithms that ignore the inertial effect of agents can lead to unstable group behavior. And even though the protocol is independent of inertia, the control gain depends quite strongly on the inertia and dynamic of the agent. Then, to address these shortcomings, an online policy iteration‐based adaptive dynamic programming is designed to tackle the challenge of double‐integrator multiagent systems without dynamics. Finally, simulation results are shown to prove how effective the proposed approach is.",2023,1

For example, a recent study [1] uses an LQR controller to balance the inverted pendulum on a quadrotor drone. However, these studies consider the length of the pendulum to be known a priori. Indeed, in certain applications this assumption might not hold true. For example, consider a quadrotor hoverboard being used by people of different heights. In such cases, an approach is required to estimate the length of the pendulum. This paper analyzes the linearized dynamics of the combined system of quadrotor and inverted pendulum. It is found that unknown length of pendulum causes the system to fall in the category of unmatched uncertain systems where the control input cannot be used to cancel the uncertainty. This paper formulates the problem in such a manner that the system is still controllable in presence of this unmatched uncertainty. A concurrent learning adaptive controller, which avoids the use of persistently exciting signals, is then utilized to estimate the unmatched uncertainty and hence the length of the pendulum. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the adaptive controller for the proposed problem.",2023,0

The main contribution of this paper is to consider a multi-objective optimization problem, which aims to minimize not only the chattering phenomenon but also other control performances including the rise time, the settling-time, the steady-state error and the overshoot. For that, a novel dynamically aggregated objective function is proposed. As a result, a set of nondominated optimal solutions are provided to the designer and then he selects the most preferable alternative. To demonstrate the efficacy and to show complete performance of the new controller, two nonlinear systems are treated in this paper: firstly, a selective compliance assembly robot arm robot is considered. The results show that the manipulator tracing performance is considerably improved with the proposed control scheme. Secondly, the proposed genetic algorithm-based linear quadratic regulator control strategy is applied for pitch and yaw axes control of two-degrees-of-freedom laboratory helicopter workstation, which is a highly nonlinear and unstable system. Experimental results substantiate that the weights optimized using genetic algorithm, result in not only reduced tracking error but also improved tracking response with reduced oscillations.",2019,8

Among the adaptive control approaches, Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) method has a systematic design feature in which response of a stable reference model is targeted to be followed by the dynamical system. In general, Linear Time Invariant (LTI) Reference Models are considered in the MRAC design and the adaptation rule is formulated accordingly. In this paper, the linear reference model is altered with a stable nonlinear one and the adaptation rule is re-formulated to cope with the nonlinearity. The stable nonlinear reference model is generated by using the State Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) approach and the adaptation rule is also updated by using the same SDRE idea. The effects of altering the linear reference model to the nonlinear counterpart are shown in the MRAC formulations. In addition to the new MRAC formulations, the proposed MRAC algorithm is applied to a 3 DoF helicopter test bed to reveal the advantages of the nonlinear reference model.",2018,3

The pitch and yaw angles are regulated to their corresponding reference angles by applying appropriate actuator commands (input voltages) to the main and tail rotors of a 2-DOF helicopter using the proposed reinforcement learning [herein called the approximate dynamic programming (ADP)] strategy. Furthermore, the proposed strategy has the ability to configure the 2-DOF helicopter to track time-varying reference angles. The proposed ADP technique is capable of dealing with coupling effects between the rigid body structure and propeller dynamics associated with the 2-DOF helicopter model considered in this work.

The helicopter is an important model from the control prospective due to its nonlinear behavior, highly cross coupling effects and instability in open loop. Classical control methods (PI, PD and PID Controllers) and baseline controllers with a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) are unable to handle parametric uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics. The key advantage of the proposed scheme is that it gives robustness to parameter uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics. An adaptive update can provide system robustness through estimation of parameters and model uncertainties. Simulation and Experimental results support the expected effectiveness of the proposed adaptive integral backstepping scheme for tracking as compared to the baseline controller (LQR) in presence of uncertainties.",2017,21

The ubiquitous Linear-Quadratic-Regulator (LQR) is employed as the baseline state-feedback controller. Despite its optimality, the LQR lacks robustness against parametric uncertainties. Hence, the main contribution of this paper is to devise and retrofit the LQR with a stable online gain-adjustment mechanism that dynamically adjusts the state weighting-coefficients of LQR’s quadratic cost-function via state-error dependent nonlinear-scaling functions. An original self-mutating phase-based adaptive modulation scheme is systematically formulated in this paper to self-adjust the state weighting-coefficients. The scheme employs pre-calibrated secant-hyperbolic-functions whose waveforms are dynamically reconfigured online based on the variations in magnitude and polarity of state-error variables. This augmentation dynamically alters the solution of the Riccati-Equation which modifies the state-feedback gains online. The proposed adaptation flexibly manipulates the system’s control effort as the response converges to or diverges from the reference. The efficacy of proposed adaptive controller is validated by conducting hardware-in-the-loop experiments to vertically stabilize the QNET 2.0 Rotary Pendulum system. As compared to the standard LQR, the proposed adaptive controller renders rapid transits in system’s response with improved damping against oscillations, while maintaining its asymptotic-stability, under bounded exogenous disturbances.",2020,21

And then, the sliding-mode disturbance observers (SMDOs) are established to deal with the immeasurable disturbances in each order of the state-constrained uncertain nonlinear systems. Besides, the dynamic threshold-based event-sampling mechanism is constructed to deal with the sparsity of resources and system controlling burden.

A throttling system with good performance improves efficiency of a launch vehicle and may enable the ability to land softly. Most rockets achieved thrust throttling by controlling a valve or venturi. Common control schemes require depth knowledge on the flow characteristics and apply classic linear control theories. In the past, we employed a “continuous” gain scheduling controller on a ball valve to regulate oxidizer flow rate in hybrid rocket engines. However, it required tremendous effort on modeling and tuning to ensure uniform performance across multi-engine rocket. To circumvent this, a model reference adaptive control (MRAC) technique is derived and investigated in this paper. The adaptive law for control gain adjustment was derived with the well-known MIT rule. The model reference adaptive system (MRAS) was simulated in different scenarios to evaluate its performance. The encouraging results suggest that MRAC has a huge potential for the throttling application in real-world rocket engines.",2023,0

Motivated by the classical model reference adaptive control, in this paper, we propose a simple and efficient scheme, called the model reference adaptive consensus (MRACon), by arranging each agent a reference to track. Under this scheme, the consensus problem is divided into two parts, namely, the tracking of the output of the reference models for the uncertain agent dynamics and the consensus of the reference models themselves. The proposed algorithms can be implemented using the relative measurements in the absence of communication. Furthermore, the results have been extended to the cases of switching directed graphs, unknown control directions, and general linear uncertain multi-agent systems.",2018,9

The main idea here, is that if system identification techniques can be made computationally light, and if they can be combined efficiently with a controller formulation, such a framework can be implemented on real world systems to achieve the adaptive nature in control. In the first part of the thesis, we focus on developing a computationally less expensive identification technique, by making various modifications on the N2SID algorithm, a nuclear norm subspace identification method. By allowing for early stopping of the ADMM algorithm (which plays a crucial role in N2SID) and by implementing an efficient alternative to Singular Value Thresholding, we are able to obtain significant reductions in computation time. Furthermore, we allow for a recursive implementation of N2SID by utilizing system information from the previous identification cycle. This results in a significant improvement of the convergence speed of the identification. In order to create an efficient interface between the identification technique and the controller, we formulate an MPC control framework, which does not require the explicit computation of the system matrices at each identification cycle. This helps in reducing the computation time of the recursive algorithm. The overall methodology is such that an inherently adaptive controller is in play at every time instant. To test this algorithm, we implement it on different systems, including LTI and LPV systems. Master of Science Thesis Bhagyashri Telsang",2016,0

Requirement engineering involves the consideration of competing needs and concerns for the proper presentation of the specification of software systems. The analysis of the Scenario-Based Specifications (SBS) has many important advantages to minimize the generation of unexpected behaviours in DSS. These behaviours are known as Emergent Behaviours (EB), and can potentially lead to irreversible, costly damages. In this thesis, we focus on analyzing the software behaviours from the SBS to detect EBs. The verification of the software behaviours in the early stages of software development can detect and prevent unwanted behaviours. In this thesis, different methodologies that aim to detect EBs are discussed. This thesis aims to provide a new automated, homogenous methodology to detect EBs based on their common cause of occurrence. Subsequently, different algorithms were proposed to detect the types of EBs, and examples were presented to explain the algorithms. With the adoption of data analysis techniques, we contribute to preventing these behaviours and ensuring system quality. To evaluate the proposed methodology based on the analysis of the SBS, we used two different approaches: (1) the conventional way by comparing the proposed methodology against related works’ methodologies, (2) the dynamic analysis of system traces, which requires the simulation of the SBS to aggregate the system behaviour in runtime. Results show a higher efficiency of the proposed methodology in detecting EBs compared to similar work, which was also proven by the statistical modelling of the case studies’ traces. Additionally, we verified the efficiency of the proposed methodology using sequential pattern mining techniques. This thesis contributes to the research of requirement engineering specifically and software engineering generally by providing an automated methodology to analyze the SBS as a black box. It assists the reusability of components and design sustainability. Moreover, the early identification of the cause of EBs empowers the designer and the software development team to handle these EBs and aids in decreasing the system cost.",2021,0

The focus is on two types of UAVs; a Quadrotor UAV and a Fixed wing UAV. Decentralized anti-windup compensators are designed to address the problem of magnitude saturation in Quadrotor UAVs. The developed anti-windup compensators are founded on an LMI-based approach previously used in literature to provide global stabilty guarantees with some level of performance guarantees. The work on the decentralized anti-windup compensators for Quadrotor UAVs are further improved on by replacing the use of LMIs in the determination of the anti windup compensator parameters with approximate linear based guidelines after a Lure-Postinikov Lyapunov function is used to provide global stability guarantees. This approach applies not only to Quadrotor UAVs but also to a wide class of systems that contain double integrators. The developed anti-windup compensators were designed and implemented for an experimental Quadrotor UAV where both simulation results and flight test results clearly show the ability of the anti-windup compensators to reduce the effect of magnitude saturation in Quadrotor UAVs. Finally, the thesis describes the design of decoupled multivariable anti-windup compensators to tackle the problem of rate saturation on a fixed wing UAVs. Simulation results obtained demonstrate that these anti-windup compensators are capable of managing the system responses during periods of rate saturation.",2017,0
